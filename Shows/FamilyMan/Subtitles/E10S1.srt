1
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:20,604
Faizan Bhai, please excuse us.

2
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:39,373
I have a very special mission for you.

3
00:00:40,082 --> 00:00:41,876
Mission Zulfiqar.

4
00:00:44,795 --> 00:00:47,047
We have a huge stock of nerve gas.

5
00:00:47,214 --> 00:00:50,968
I want you to use it
to attack Delhi.

6
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,513
Do you realize what you're suggesting?

7
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:59,268
This will be the biggest attack on India.

8
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,562
And it will lead to a war.

9
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:04,273
Listen carefully, Moosa.

10
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:06,984
Only a few people know about this.

11
00:01:07,193 --> 00:01:09,862
And now, you are one of them.

12
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:12,490
Even Faizan has no knowledge about this.

13
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,241
Do you get me?

14
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,581
But ISIS won't let me go.

15
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,752
If I was in their place,
I wouldn't have either.

16
00:01:25,169 --> 00:01:26,504
But don't you worry.

17
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:30,466
Getting you to India
is my responsibility.

18
00:01:31,175 --> 00:01:34,637
You'll get the rest
of the details soon.

19
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,808
India won't be the only country

20
00:01:38,891 --> 00:01:41,143
that will try to stop this plan.

21
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:45,147
Even Pakistan will
create hurdles for us.

22
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:48,526
That's why I want you to
create a backup plan.

23
00:01:48,984 --> 00:01:50,402
Plan B.

24
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:55,658
God forbid if somebody asks you
to abort the mission midway...

25
00:01:56,283 --> 00:01:58,077
even if that is me...

26
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,163
it will only mean one thing.

27
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,290
Plan B.

28
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:06,377
Only two people know about this.

29
00:02:07,503 --> 00:02:09,797
Me and you.

30
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,091
But what is Plan B?

31
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:14,635
-Another bomb?
-Something like that.

32
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,305
It's been in Delhi for many years.

33
00:02:20,015 --> 00:02:23,102
We just have to activate it.

34
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:28,440
And what do I need to do?

35
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:35,114
Go meet him.

36
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,658
He's critical for Plan B.

37
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:32,671
You look nice.

38
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,091
And...

39
00:03:37,468 --> 00:03:39,219
how's the new job?

40
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,597
It's nice.

41
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:44,767
How was Kashmir?

42
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,937
Kashmir? It's a long story.

43
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,398
Let's go somewhere...

44
00:03:52,191 --> 00:03:53,484
on a holiday.

45
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:57,071
I'll tell you about Kashmir.

46
00:03:57,154 --> 00:04:00,449
And you can tell me about
your new job in detail.

47
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:01,617
Holiday?

48
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:03,661
Why not?

49
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:04,870
We can drive...

50
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,916
to Lonavala.

51
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:12,920
Or...

52
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:15,172
Mahabaleshwar.

53
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,218
Alright, let's drive

54
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:21,762
for twelve hours and go to Goa.

55
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:24,890
-Good idea.
-I'll drop the kids today.

56
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:26,892
But the auto-rickshaw guy is here.

57
00:04:26,976 --> 00:04:28,018
So what?

58
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:30,187
I am their father,
I can drop them.

59
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,147
The auto-rickshaw guy
is not their father.

60
00:05:01,719 --> 00:05:03,053
Wow!

61
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:16,567
Wow!

62
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:18,694
Shall we?

63
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:29,121
Dad, you won't believe it
but Suchi is a better driver.

64
00:05:29,246 --> 00:05:30,539
Oh, please!

65
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,253
Is she really that good?

66
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,131
Good? She's amazing!
Just like Fast &amp; Furious.

67
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,926
Dhriti, what's trending
on Instagram nowadays?

68
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,473
Any new update?

69
00:05:49,308 --> 00:05:50,726
What do they call it?

70
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:52,186
"May-may."

71
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:54,104
It's "meme," Dad.
Not "may-may."

72
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,482
-Get it right.
-All right! Meme.

73
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,195
You haven't checked
your phone even once.

74
00:06:01,945 --> 00:06:03,322
First tell me.

75
00:06:03,906 --> 00:06:06,075
-Are you and Mom getting a divorce?
-What?

76
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:09,328
-Where did that come from?
-What do you mean?

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,538
Earlier, you never used to be home.

78
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:13,082
Now, even Mom's never home.

79
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,917
You two don't talk like you used to.

80
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,086
And we never go out, like never.

81
00:06:17,252 --> 00:06:18,796
And you tend to disappear.

82
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,131
I feel like I don't
even know who you are.

83
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:23,467
Do you even know what's
going on in my life?

84
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,344
Or Mom's life?

85
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,678
You know nothing!

86
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:47,574
If you two get divorced,
I am warning you...

87
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,785
you guys will have it from me!

88
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:53,664
Dad!

89
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,291
I found your secret gun.

90
00:06:57,126 --> 00:06:58,168
What?

91
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:00,045
-Where?
-In your room.

92
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:07,052
Now don't go around
advertising that.

93
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,599
Shall we go for an ice cream
after class?

94
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,061
Ice cream won't do,
I want an iPhone.

95
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,563
Bye.

96
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:32,035
Stop, motherfucker!

97
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,793
-Give him one.
-No.

98
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:40,794
I did yoga this morning.

99
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,129
Don't ruin it.

100
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,631
One Vada Pav 
won't make a difference.

101
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,634
-Give him one.
-Major terror plan averted in Kashmir.

102
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:49,636
Actually, their target was Delhi.

103
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,931
The spokesperson for the NIA
issued a statement saying

104
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:57,019
the planned terror strike in
Delhi was way bigger than 26/11

105
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,687
in terms of scale
and lives lost.

106
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,606
Nonsense!
This is their regular shit.

107
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:03,066
If they could have avoided
26/11, why didn't they?

108
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,526
Were they playing marbles then?

109
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,236
These people from NIA and MIA

110
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,572
sit in their AC cabins all day
and lounge about.

111
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,450
And then, those assholes speak
of averting terror attacks.

112
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:32,638
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.

113
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:21,186
Sir.

114
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,730
Srikant, I'm afraid 
 there's some bad news.

115
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:26,775
We started celebrating
too early.

116
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,656
I am sending you a recording.
Listen to it.

117
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,074
Yes, bhai?

118
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:36,576
Tell the groom right away 
 that he shouldn't go collect the turban.

119
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,455
-Has the wedding been called off? 
 -No.

120
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,792
The wedding will take place 
 on the decided date.

121
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,585
Now listen carefully.

122
00:09:45,794 --> 00:09:48,297
Tell the groom right away to go to Delhi

123
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,715
and meet his elder brother.

124
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:51,758
Meet his Chettan.

125
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:53,885
He has chosen another 
 girl for him.

126
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:55,262
He'll explain everything.

127
00:09:55,887 --> 00:09:57,848
The groom stands for Sajid.

128
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:02,602
Turban stands for nerve gas.

129
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,106
And Chettan means Moosa.

130
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:09,609
Another girl means they
have another bomb...

131
00:10:09,818 --> 00:10:11,528
or another backup plan.

132
00:10:12,029 --> 00:10:13,905
Zulfiqar is not over.

133
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,743
So what's the plan of action now?

134
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:21,204
We need to go to Delhi.
Right away, sir.

135
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:48,625
-Good evening, sir.
-Water.

136
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:54,673
Thank you.

137
00:11:58,552 --> 00:11:59,553
Hi.

138
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,054
Hi.

139
00:12:11,189 --> 00:12:13,650
Can we speak privately, Vaibhav?

140
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:16,903
Have we met before?

141
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:19,948
Come.

142
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,426
Whoever you are,
there's nothing you can do.

143
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,096
The Supreme Court
has made this legal.

144
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,100
Try telling this to your wife.

145
00:12:50,187 --> 00:12:53,023
Motherfucker!
Who are you?

146
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:56,026
-If you act too smart--
-1311...

147
00:12:56,151 --> 00:12:58,528
Mayur Vihar, Phase 1, Pocket 2.

148
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,614
That's your address, right?

149
00:13:01,072 --> 00:13:04,576
Please don't send it to my house.

150
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:10,040
I don't have anything to give you.

151
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:12,125
I'm an employee in a chemical factory.

152
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:13,960
My salary is barely enough
for my expenses.

153
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:16,338
-If you want I can--
-Did I ask you for money?

154
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,508
Then?

155
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:20,884
You'll get a phone call.

156
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:25,555
Just do as you're told.

157
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,015
What do I have to do?

158
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:34,689
Listen to me. Excuse me...

159
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,839
You still didn't find it?

160
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,968
Are you looking for a camera?

161
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:07,597
-Did you find it?
-Finders keepers.

162
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,226
I'll pay you for it.

163
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,728
Please give me that camera.

164
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:16,773
You'll need to pay a lot for it.

165
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,608
Do you have that kind of money?

166
00:14:19,025 --> 00:14:20,235
How much do you want?

167
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:24,281
I'll take at least 500 rupees.

168
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:29,077
Send Moosa's and Sajid's pictures
to every news channel.

169
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,830
Tell the Delhi Police to use
its social media cell

170
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:33,915
to flash their photos
through every handle.

171
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,917
All police stations
should get these instructions.

172
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:38,962
Their patrolling vans should
be on alert, 24 hours.

173
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,214
We can't afford a single mistake.

174
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:44,175
We have to be at our best.
Carry on.

175
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:45,677
-Srikant.
-Yes, sir.

176
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:47,304
-Any updates.
-No, sir.

177
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:50,265
-Delhi police are on red alert.
-I have a meeting with the NSA.

178
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,684
-Keep me posted, please.
-Sure, sir.

179
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,603
Sharma, let's go.

180
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:57,814
Zoya, keep monitoring
the CCTV cameras.

181
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,774
Milind, toll-free number?

182
00:14:59,858 --> 00:15:02,485
Sir, we got many calls,
mostly false alarms.

183
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,945
Although we're following
a couple of leads.

184
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:04,988
Keep all the lines open.

185
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,740
You'll surely get some information.

186
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:07,907
-Yes, sir.
-Okay?

187
00:15:07,991 --> 00:15:09,117
On it, sir.

188
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:16,207
40 rupees.

189
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:31,431
If you have any information
about Moosa Rahman or Sajid

190
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:35,226
call the number listed below.

191
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:39,356
The informant will be rewarded
with ten lakh rupees.

192
00:15:40,482 --> 00:15:41,733
Ten lakh!

193
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,784
Will I get my money?

194
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,244
The government has promised it.
You will get it.

195
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:55,789
The government also promised us
15 lakh rupees.

196
00:15:55,997 --> 00:15:57,582
That's why I had a
bank account opened.

197
00:15:57,666 --> 00:15:59,417
I haven't received a single rupee.

198
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:12,472
Tiwari, we found Moosa's mother.

199
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,140
-What?
-Yeah.

200
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:16,518
Finally.

201
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,687
Get her to Delhi right away.

202
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:20,647
You really think that will help us?

203
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:22,774
After the riots,

204
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:25,652
when Moosa was searching for his family,

205
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:27,070
he found his mother

206
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:30,448
sitting next to the cremated
bodies of his father and sister.

207
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:32,158
She had somehow managed to survive.

208
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:34,369
She went into trauma.

209
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,081
It took Moosa many years
to help her recover.

210
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,209
When the doctors reassured
him that she wouldn't die

211
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:44,295
he left home to seek revenge.

212
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,007
Tell me. Helpful or not?

213
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:49,676
How do you know this?

214
00:16:50,093 --> 00:16:51,553
Moosa told me...

215
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,097
along with all the other bullshit!

216
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:57,434
Sir, we got a call from a bar called Oaks.

217
00:16:57,517 --> 00:16:59,936
The bartender saw Sajid.

218
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:01,813
Okay, check it out.

219
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,732
Come on, guys. On it.

220
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,400
Let's go! Right away.

221
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:30,383
Hi, I am Kareem Bhat.

222
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,969
That's Nissar and Iqbal.

223
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:35,472
We will teach Deshpande and 
 his supporters a lesson.

224
00:17:35,638 --> 00:17:37,348
They killed two of our Muslim brothers

225
00:17:37,432 --> 00:17:39,559
because they suspected that 
 they were carrying beef.

226
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:43,688
Today, we will feed beef 
 to Deshpande and all his men.

227
00:17:54,491 --> 00:17:57,869
Jonali, they're hunting us 
 down like animals. Shit!

228
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:10,423
I hope you find this camera 
 and that justice prevails.

229
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,635
I love you, Jonali.

230
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,022
Yes, that's him.

231
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,525
So many people come here.
How can you be so sure?

232
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,734
I remember him.

233
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,653
He was with Vaibhav.

234
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,863
Vaibhav is a regular customer here.

235
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:37,075
They were sitting at that table
and chatting for some time.

236
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:41,162
Then suddenly, this guy left
and Vaibhav broke into tears.

237
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,956
He seemed worried.

238
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,083
What is Vaibhav's full name?

239
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:49,170
-I don't remember.
-How does he pay? Cash or card?

240
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,964
He always paid by card.

241
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:53,216
Could you please
get the card receipts?

242
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:54,425
Thank you.

243
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:56,094
His name is Vaibhav Therani.

244
00:18:56,261 --> 00:18:57,804
T-H-E-R-A-N-I.

245
00:18:57,887 --> 00:18:59,931
Vaibhav Therani.

246
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:02,100
Yes, get all the available
information on him.

247
00:19:12,277 --> 00:19:13,403
Moosa?

248
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,530
What are we going to do
with so much water?

249
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,407
We'll need it.

250
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:20,118
This is not normal water.

251
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:23,621
I have mixed metallic impurities in it...

252
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:26,416
to make a colloidal solution.

253
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,835
This water is very useful, Sajid.

254
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,179
-Okay, sir. I am leaving,
-Good night.

255
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:41,264
Bye.

256
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,553
Vaibhav. Vaibhav Therani.

257
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:22,597
He's a production manager
at Orion Chemicals.

258
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,141
-Anything else?
-Not much.

259
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:26,851
-Milind.
-Sir.

260
00:20:26,976 --> 00:20:28,728
Vaibhav's phone is switched off.

261
00:20:28,853 --> 00:20:30,480
I spoke to his wife.

262
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:33,650
He's usually home by
this time, but not today.

263
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,776
Maybe he's in office.

264
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:36,653
We don't know exactly where he is.

265
00:20:37,111 --> 00:20:39,405
What if Moosa and Sajid

266
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,575
planned to steal chemicals
from this factory?

267
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:44,160
Is it possible?

268
00:20:46,829 --> 00:20:48,289
Milind, both of you...

269
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:51,042
go to Orion Chemicals and look around.

270
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,001
-Keep updating me.
-Yes, sir.

271
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:52,919
Okay?

272
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,547
Puneet, I need all the
details of Orion Chemicals.

273
00:20:56,631 --> 00:21:00,927
Banking transactions, balance sheets,
funding sources, the lot.

274
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:16,192
-Open the gate.
-The factory's closed.

275
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:18,945
We want to meet your
manager, Vaibhav Therani.

276
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,446
He left for the day.

277
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,573
There's nobody inside.
You can come back tomorrow.

278
00:21:22,657 --> 00:21:23,741
Shut up and open the door.

279
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:25,326
Please speak to the supervisor.

280
00:21:25,493 --> 00:21:26,536
Get him.

281
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,040
Sir...

282
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:41,134
-Whom do you want to meet?
-Vaibhav Therani.

283
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,427
He left.

284
00:21:42,844 --> 00:21:44,929
There's only the security staff now.

285
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,023
What are these tanks?

286
00:21:56,649 --> 00:21:58,985
E1, E2, and E3.

287
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,112
How are they connected to each other?

288
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:04,741
E1 and E2 are connected to E3 via inlets.

289
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:08,453
What is the available stock
of methylamine and phosgene?

290
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,915
Answer the question!

291
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,173
E1 has 30 tons of phosgene
and chloroform compound.

292
00:22:20,548 --> 00:22:22,425
E2 has 20 tons of methylamine.

293
00:22:23,676 --> 00:22:25,136
What are you guys going to do?

294
00:22:27,472 --> 00:22:29,348
Shut up and open the door.

295
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,975
Do you have a warrant?

296
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:32,643
You need a warrant?

297
00:22:33,895 --> 00:22:35,063
You need a warrant?

298
00:22:35,813 --> 00:22:39,484
If you act too smart,
I'll throw all of you behind bars.

299
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,902
Just open the gate.

300
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,494
Open it.

301
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,849
Stop them.

302
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:15,686
Moosa, there are a few
policemen downstairs.

303
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:17,480
-Why?
-I don't know.

304
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,149
-Bablu is with them. Hurry up.
-Okay.

305
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,111
Let's continue.

306
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,161
We'll go ahead.

307
00:23:32,370 --> 00:23:33,579
You two, go there.

308
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:52,974
Let's go this way.

309
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,336
First, release the nitrogen from the tank.

310
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:25,464
That's very dangerous.
What are you doing?

311
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,595
Enter the password.

312
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:32,972
Do it!

313
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,615
-What's that?
-Control room.

314
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:52,450
We should take a look.

315
00:24:52,533 --> 00:24:54,285
Ma'am, you don't have the permission.

316
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:55,369
Yeah, yeah!

317
00:24:55,453 --> 00:24:57,663
I told you, Vaibhav's not here.

318
00:24:57,997 --> 00:25:00,625
You'll get all of us in trouble.

319
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,960
Moosa, they're coming
towards the control room.

320
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:05,713
Come on, quick!

321
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,852
What did you do?
Are you out of your mind?

322
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:21,646
You are killing everybody in sight.

323
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,773
What do we do now?

324
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,153
Yes, sir?

325
00:25:30,071 --> 00:25:33,074
Yes, sir. We are at the factory.

326
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:37,245
Yeah, Vaibhav is not here.
In fact, the factory is closed.

327
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:40,498
Right, sir.

328
00:25:40,623 --> 00:25:41,874
Okay, bye.

329
00:25:41,999 --> 00:25:43,167
Srikant wants us back.

330
00:25:45,127 --> 00:25:46,796
Let's check it out anyway.

331
00:25:51,968 --> 00:25:53,344
Let's go. Come.

332
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,744
Let's go.

333
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:40,891
What do we do now?

334
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:45,104
We got what we wanted from him.

335
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:48,065
I'll take care of the rest.

336
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,236
-Anything?
-Nothing at all, sir.

337
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,280
Let's go.

338
00:26:56,073 --> 00:26:57,283
When MIC mixes with water,

339
00:26:57,366 --> 00:26:58,909
it results in an exothermic reaction.

340
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:00,953
I've put phosgene and methylamine
in the third tank

341
00:27:01,037 --> 00:27:01,871
so that they react.

342
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,457
We just need to disable
the scrubber tank.

343
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,334
You sound like...

344
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:09,128
a kid in a toy store.

345
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:16,761
You see this tank?
Do you know what it does?

346
00:27:16,844 --> 00:27:18,846
It diverts all the toxic gases
from the factory

347
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,890
to a caustic soda chamber.

348
00:27:21,015 --> 00:27:22,933
This removes all the
toxicity from the gases.

349
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:24,643
We need to disable this chamber.

350
00:27:31,192 --> 00:27:32,651
Now one last thing.

351
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,320
You saw that flare tower outside?

352
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:35,738
It burns all the toxic gases

353
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,782
so that they don't mix
with the atmosphere.

354
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,534
Disabled.

355
00:27:48,542 --> 00:27:49,752
Perfect.

356
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,588
Now Delhi will pay for its sins.

357
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,468
That was it?

358
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,929
That was a bit underwhelming.

359
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:02,515
Remember the 1984 Bhopal disaster?

360
00:28:02,973 --> 00:28:05,601
Thousands suffered
a painful death.

361
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,520
Delhi will become
another Bhopal.

362
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:10,064
But a big blast
would've been more fun.

363
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,317
You don't get it.

364
00:28:14,235 --> 00:28:16,404
Our purpose is not just
to kill them,

365
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,322
but also punish them...

366
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:20,741
and their future generations.

367
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:23,202
They will die a pitiful death.

368
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,706
Even the unborn will die
in its mother's womb.

369
00:28:27,998 --> 00:28:29,959
And if some bastard does manage
to take birth

370
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:31,877
he'll live with a
crippling disease.

371
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:34,296
Then those bastards won't ever dare touch

372
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:37,216
our mothers and sisters.

373
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,844
They won't ever dare
kill our family members.

374
00:28:40,553 --> 00:28:43,055
Tell me, is this
spectacle good enough for you?

375
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:53,941
Tiwari, please sit down.

376
00:28:54,442 --> 00:28:56,569
You're stressing me out as well.

377
00:28:57,319 --> 00:28:59,780
Milind said everything's okay
at the factory.

378
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:05,453
Circulate Vaibhav Therani's
photo to all police stations.

379
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:08,706
Ask someone to go
speak to his family.

380
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,542
Ask Milind and Zoya to go there.

381
00:29:11,709 --> 00:29:13,669
-Are they back?
-They're on their way.

382
00:29:16,046 --> 00:29:17,965
-Hurry up, man.
-I'm sorry.

383
00:29:21,802 --> 00:29:23,512
Where the fuck is
Vaibhav Therani?

384
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:26,056
He's neither home nor at the factory.

385
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:27,516
Where do you think he'd be?

386
00:29:27,683 --> 00:29:28,934
Some bar maybe?

387
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:32,438
Something seemed off at the factory.
Don't you think?

388
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:33,397
What?

389
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:38,652
Weren't the guards
a bit strange?

390
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:41,280
You know, come to think of it,
the other guard was also behaving

391
00:29:41,363 --> 00:29:43,532
-very strangely.
-Something is amiss.

392
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:45,618
It's my instinct.

393
00:29:47,036 --> 00:29:49,246
Do you remember the control room?

394
00:29:49,455 --> 00:29:51,415
The guards told us the factory's shut.

395
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:53,542
Then why was the computer on?

396
00:29:54,001 --> 00:29:56,504
And did you notice the water tanker
outside the factory?

397
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:58,464
-Yes, why?
-Nothing...

398
00:29:58,547 --> 00:30:00,257
I just asked for a list
of stolen vehicles

399
00:30:00,341 --> 00:30:01,800
in the last 48 hours in the area.

400
00:30:01,884 --> 00:30:03,719
And I think I saw...

401
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:06,263
I knew it!

402
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,557
The water tanker.

403
00:30:08,849 --> 00:30:11,310
-You think it's the same truck?
-Shall we go check?

404
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,405
Moosa Bhai!

405
00:30:24,532 --> 00:30:26,200
-Are you two leaving?
-Yes.

406
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,160
Should I leave too?

407
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:30,704
-No.
-Yes.

408
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,830
Stay here.

409
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:34,625
Ensure that nobody gets in.

410
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:37,795
And leave before the factory
opens in the morning.

411
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:39,213
Alright.

412
00:30:44,802 --> 00:30:47,638
You said all of Delhi will
be a graveyard by morning.

413
00:30:47,888 --> 00:30:48,847
Yes.

414
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:52,434
And by that time we will be
far away from Delhi.

415
00:30:52,935 --> 00:30:54,144
And what about them?

416
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,398
You asked them to stay there all night.

417
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:00,901
War involves sacrifices.
They will be martyred.

418
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,653
They will enjoy heaven.

419
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:09,702
Let her sit in the waiting room.
We're coming right away.

420
00:31:10,494 --> 00:31:11,912
Tiwari...

421
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:13,706
she's in the waiting room.

422
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,333
-Who?
-Moosa's mother.

423
00:31:21,213 --> 00:31:22,798
Have you thought about
what you're going to say?

424
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:26,010
There is only one way
to make a mother talk.

425
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,563
-Namaste.
-Namaste.

426
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:40,399
This is my friend, JK.

427
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:47,489
Where is my son?

428
00:31:47,573 --> 00:31:49,533
What did you do to him?

429
00:31:49,783 --> 00:31:52,161
I want to meet him right now.

430
00:31:52,286 --> 00:31:54,705
Please take me to him.

431
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,969
Ma'am... I know
very little Malayalam.

432
00:32:10,387 --> 00:32:11,513
We can talk in Hindi.

433
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:13,474
-Hindi?
-Yes, Hindi.

434
00:32:29,239 --> 00:32:31,533
When my mother passed away...

435
00:32:35,496 --> 00:32:37,790
I wasn't able to speak to her.

436
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,968
The wind is strong.

437
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,513
The gas should engulf
Delhi in two hours.

438
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,306
Inshallah!

439
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:56,767
I can't wait to read the
papers tomorrow.

440
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:00,020
War is inevitable now.

441
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:03,023
There will be destruction
as far as the eye can see.

442
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,111
We have done what our brothers
were attempting for so many years.

443
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,698
You and I, Sajid.

444
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:20,958
What are you going
to do after this?

445
00:33:23,252 --> 00:33:24,753
I'll go to my hometown.

446
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,047
Kerala?

447
00:33:27,881 --> 00:33:29,258
Yes, Kasaragod.

448
00:33:30,759 --> 00:33:32,261
I'll look for my mother.

449
00:33:59,246 --> 00:34:00,706
-Fill it up.
-Okay, sir.

450
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:02,791
I'll be right back.

451
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,313
...mother of wanted terrorist Moosa Rahman

452
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,733
has appeared on national television 
 appealing to her son, to return.

453
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:29,234
Moosa, my son...

454
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:34,698
I refuse to believe whatever 
 I've heard about you.

455
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,451
I have come to Delhi to see you.

456
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:41,288
Where are you, son? 
 I want to meet you, Moosa.

457
00:34:41,872 --> 00:34:45,584
You must prove their 
 allegations wrong.

458
00:34:45,709 --> 00:34:47,628
Son, please call 
 me on this number.

459
00:34:47,711 --> 00:34:49,630
Will you call me, Moosa?

460
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:30,045
Moosa, our years of hard work,
all our planning...

461
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,964
everything will go in vain.

462
00:35:32,047 --> 00:35:33,674
We're not aborting the mission.

463
00:35:34,424 --> 00:35:35,926
We're just delaying it by a few days.

464
00:35:36,009 --> 00:35:38,178
We'll never get a better opportunity.

465
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:41,223
-So far, nothing's gone wrong.
-I know.

466
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:44,768
But I did it, didn't I?

467
00:35:46,687 --> 00:35:48,856
And I can do it again.

468
00:35:49,606 --> 00:35:51,149
We'll find another factory.

469
00:35:52,025 --> 00:35:53,735
If not in Delhi, then in Mumbai.

470
00:35:54,361 --> 00:35:57,489
-A larger number of people will die.
-Think about it.

471
00:35:57,573 --> 00:35:59,783
For all you know, everything
must be over by now.

472
00:36:00,576 --> 00:36:03,495
If the gas must've started leaking,

473
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:05,831
-we'll get stuck.
-So what do I do?

474
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:08,292
Let my mother die?

475
00:36:24,892 --> 00:36:27,561
Sorry, Moosa. I won't let this happen.

476
00:36:30,105 --> 00:36:31,607
Turn the car around.

477
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,212
Fuck! We have to inform Srikant!

478
00:36:54,421 --> 00:36:55,589
Call for backup.

479
00:36:59,593 --> 00:37:01,345
Listen to me, stop the car.

480
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:07,267
Moosa, don't force me to do this.

481
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,437
I said turn the car--

482
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:04,825
Fuck, there's no network.

483
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:14,251
Bablu Bhai, the police are here.

484
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,172
Milind!

485
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:22,994
Tiwari!

486
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:24,079
Tiwari!

487
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,749
They found Moosa's body.
