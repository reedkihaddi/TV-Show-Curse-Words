1
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:39,582
-How long till we're in Kochi?
-An hour.

2
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:42,543
The engine will heat up if
we continue at full speed.

3
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,504
This is the coast guard. 
 Identify yourself.

4
00:00:45,713 --> 00:00:47,006
Over.

5
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,300
Don't stop. Ignore it.

6
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:51,969
Identify yourself.

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,722
-Keep going at full speed.
-And defy the coast guard?

8
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,808
Son of a bitch!
Keep going at full speed!

9
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,935
Unless you want to
join your captain.

10
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:02,313
Speed up, motherfucker!

11
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,362
Asif Bhai, what are you doing?

12
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:13,073
Moosa, stop it.
I know what I'm doing.

13
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,625
Son of a bitch!

14
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,962
It was not a good idea
to hijack the boat.

15
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:28,506
Shut up, Moosa!

16
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,800
We should've stayed in Lakshadweep

17
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,760
for a few more days.

18
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:35,054
We should've waited, Asif Bhai.

19
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,765
Moosa, for the last time.
Stay out of this.

20
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:38,933
I'm the one in command.

21
00:01:39,016 --> 00:01:40,810
Abu, you're a mechanical engineer, right?

22
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:42,603
Can you fix the engine?

23
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:51,862
Let's fucking get them!

24
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:53,906
We'll take them by surprise.

25
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,742
Asif Bhai, I'm telling you,
it's not a good idea.

26
00:01:56,826 --> 00:02:00,079
Shut up or I swear to God
I'll kill you first!

27
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:18,222
You son of a bitch!

28
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,268
What the fuck did you do?

29
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,687
I don't want to die here.

30
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,147
Not unless I kill you first!

31
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,989
All aboard, come onto the deck.

32
00:02:35,614 --> 00:02:36,991
Drop your weapons.

33
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,743
I repeat, drop your weapons.

34
00:02:42,788 --> 00:02:44,623
All aboard, come onto the deck.

35
00:02:44,832 --> 00:02:46,250
Hands in the air.

36
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:48,836
I repeat, hands in the air.

37
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,560
Sri, did you take your tablets?

38
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,271
-I kept them on the table.
-Yes, I did.

39
00:03:55,653 --> 00:03:56,946
Did you pay the electricity bill?

40
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:58,447
They've sent a disconnection notice.

41
00:03:58,572 --> 00:04:00,950
I went there yesterday,
but the counter was closed.

42
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,077
Don't make excuses!

43
00:04:03,202 --> 00:04:04,912
These days, everything can be done online.

44
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:06,038
Listen.

45
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:08,791
-Will you drop the kids to school?
-No, I can't!

46
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,460
Srikant, I do everything for the kids!

47
00:04:11,543 --> 00:04:14,213
Can't you help me just this once?

48
00:04:14,546 --> 00:04:18,133
I have a joint class and I'm not prepared!

49
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,385
Sri, please?

50
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:22,471
Please, Sri.
Just for today. Please?

51
00:04:28,978 --> 00:04:30,479
Dhriti, stop it!

52
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,859
-No phones.
-Mom, I don't like Idlis.

53
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,736
Since when?

54
00:04:38,237 --> 00:04:40,739
There's sambar,
chutney, and podi on the side.

55
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:41,949
What else do you want?

56
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,617
Mom, I don't like ghee anymore.

57
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,995
All you kids want is junk food.

58
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:48,580
You're satisfied only
when you eat that stuff.

59
00:04:48,664 --> 00:04:49,873
Finish it.

60
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,125
I'm not hungry.

61
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,710
You'll stay hungry till lunch?

62
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:54,586
There are people starving to death

63
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,213
and here she is,
throwing tantrums.

64
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,798
Should I make a sandwich?

65
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:01,719
-You're spoiling them!
-I am not spoilt!

66
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,345
I love Idli, Suchi.

67
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:05,597
I know, darling.
That's why you are the sweetest.

68
00:05:05,806 --> 00:05:08,225
Okay, I'm leaving. Bye.

69
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,309
-Bye, Suchi.
-Bye, Mom.

70
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:10,644
Bye, Suchi.

71
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:16,108
Eat this.
Hey, hurry up.

72
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:18,485
Dad, I don't like cheese.

73
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,990
Forgive me, Your Highness.

74
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,450
Would you like some junk food instead?

75
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,367
-Yes!
-Yes!

76
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:26,952
I want McDonald's.

77
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:37,379
It's hot! Let me switch on the AC.

78
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:41,050
-Dad!
-It's so pleasant.

79
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,342
Why do you need the AC?

80
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,303
Learn to breathe in fresh air.

81
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:47,014
Dad, when will we buy a new car?

82
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:48,974
When you start earning.

83
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:51,560
Dhriti!

84
00:05:51,643 --> 00:05:53,437
There's a world outside your phone.

85
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,022
Look around once in a while.

86
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:57,483
She chats with boys all day.

87
00:05:58,025 --> 00:05:58,859
Shut up, asshole!

88
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,695
Hey, what kind of language is that?

89
00:06:02,071 --> 00:06:04,656
Mind your tongue
in front of me!

90
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:09,703
Dad, if you join a software company
you'll get a new car.

91
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,497
Why do you want to
continue with this job?

92
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,666
Because there's not much to do
in a government job.

93
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:16,543
-Right, Dad?
-Really?

94
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,339
Why haven't you accepted
my friend request yet?

95
00:06:20,422 --> 00:06:22,299
You're not my friend,
you're my father.

96
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:23,717
She is scared, Dad.

97
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:25,844
If she accepts your friend request

98
00:06:25,969 --> 00:06:28,430
you'll find out about her boyfriends.

99
00:06:32,768 --> 00:06:34,770
Hey, you mother...

100
00:06:37,898 --> 00:06:40,234
-What happened?
-Nothing.

101
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:45,656
-What did you say?
-Nothing, man.

102
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,407
Say it, asshole.
What is it?

103
00:06:47,533 --> 00:06:50,744
Why are you cussing, man?
There are kids in the car!

104
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:52,121
Can't you see?

105
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:54,289
I'm letting you go
because of them.

106
00:06:54,873 --> 00:06:56,250
Knock some sense into your dad!

107
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:57,751
Fucking idiot!

108
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:00,546
Why didn't you say it?

109
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:03,132
I knew what you were going to say.

110
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:04,758
What are you scared of, Dad?

111
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:07,136
Fine, I'll say it.

112
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:09,263
Hey there, mother-trucker!

113
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,181
Fuck! Shut the windows!

114
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,891
-What did you say?
-Nothing!

115
00:07:12,975 --> 00:07:14,268
What did you say?

116
00:07:14,351 --> 00:07:17,062
Say it again! Fucker!

117
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,815
Are you out of your mind?

118
00:07:20,232 --> 00:07:23,235
If your mom finds out,
you'll be grounded.

119
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,821
And then blame me for it.

120
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,407
Ridiculous!

121
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:31,618
You go to such a posh school...

122
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:34,163
and use such crass words!

123
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:38,125
Now what's the difference
between you and that biker?

124
00:07:41,295 --> 00:07:42,796
You want to grow up to be like him?

125
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:47,259
When I grow up,
I'll punch everybody in the face!

126
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:53,932
There's no fresh air,
the windows are up.

127
00:07:54,725 --> 00:07:56,518
And you were apologizing
to that loser...

128
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,312
even though it was his fault!

129
00:07:58,395 --> 00:07:59,938
I'm telling you...

130
00:08:00,397 --> 00:08:03,442
the doctor accidentally
handed us somebody else's baby.

131
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,402
My real brother, that poor thing...

132
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,529
is with another family.

133
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:09,948
Take that!

134
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:12,117
What are you doing?
Stop it!

135
00:08:12,868 --> 00:08:14,494
Don't do that, Dhriti!

136
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:15,829
-Stop it!
-Continue!

137
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,166
-Stop!
-Stop!

138
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,584
Let me drop you off at the gate.

139
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,668
-No!
-No!

140
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,338
My car's not that bad.

141
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,298
You guys don't know
how lucky you are!

142
00:08:26,423 --> 00:08:28,550
I used to pedal five kilometers
to school every day.

143
00:08:28,634 --> 00:08:31,178
And grandmother used
to swim across a river!

144
00:08:32,221 --> 00:08:33,639
Ungrateful kids!

145
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,315
I'm on my way, damn it!
Get off my bloody ass!

146
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,214
You're quite early.

147
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:09,466
Just an hour late.

148
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,802
Don't kick a man when he is down!

149
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:13,720
I had to drop the kids off at school.

150
00:09:14,304 --> 00:09:16,139
Sharma is going to fuck you up today.

151
00:09:16,223 --> 00:09:17,432
Seriously?

152
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:19,059
Just a second.

153
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,603
There it is!
You're screwed!

154
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:23,563
Yes, sir.

155
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:27,401
There was a terrible accident.

156
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,780
Yes, sir. No, not me.

157
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:34,950
A taxi knocked down a Vada Pav vendor.

158
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,830
Sir, he lost a lot of blood.

159
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:42,708
Not the taxi driver.
The Vada Pav vendor.

160
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,460
I left after the
ambulance arrived.

161
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm on my way.

162
00:09:50,007 --> 00:09:51,550
I'm coming right away, sir.

163
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:53,010
Okay.

164
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:56,305
Sir, do I survive in this story?

165
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:58,307
That depends on the boss' mood.

166
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:00,142
Are you being trained
in making up stories?

167
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:01,852
You came up with one in a jiffy.

168
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,396
Get married.
You'll start inventing a lot of things!

169
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:13,196
-Hey, handsome. Spare some change for me?
-I don't have it.

170
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:56,365
-Good morning. All good?
-Good morning, sir.

171
00:10:56,823 --> 00:10:58,533
-Looking good!
-Sir.

172
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:27,104
Srikant, JK...

173
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,064
you're late for the meeting again.

174
00:11:29,648 --> 00:11:31,691
Really? Are we?

175
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:33,902
Sorry.

176
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,320
Upstairs.

177
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,615
These three were trying to
cross in through the sea route.

178
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,909
They hijacked a fishing boat
and killed the captain.

179
00:11:40,992 --> 00:11:43,120
Caught in Indian waters, south of Kochi.

180
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:45,414
They're in the coast guard's custody.

181
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,457
Moinuddin alias Asif.

182
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,585
Trivandrum bus blast.
Mysore High Court blast...

183
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,795
A suspect in both the cases.

184
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,964
The boat was registered
in Lakshadweep.

185
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:56,550
Our guess is they were
hiding there for a few days.

186
00:11:56,633 --> 00:11:57,843
Who are the other two?

187
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,428
All from Kerala.

188
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,930
They stay in Asif's neighboring villages.

189
00:12:02,013 --> 00:12:03,723
They had disappeared
a few years ago.

190
00:12:03,849 --> 00:12:05,100
It was suspected that

191
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,477
they had gone to Syria
to join the ISIS.

192
00:12:07,602 --> 00:12:10,272
Although there is no
criminal record against them.

193
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,485
Moosa Rahman from Kasaragod,
24 years old, IIT Kanpur!

194
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:17,863
Imtiaz Aboobacker...

195
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,281
There are orders from Delhi...

196
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,075
to interrogate them and
gather intelligence.

197
00:12:22,159 --> 00:12:23,660
The court has granted
us a week's custody.

198
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,787
The CISF team will be
handing them over today.

199
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,914
Both of you go and supervise it.

200
00:12:28,165 --> 00:12:31,543
Force One will be there
for tactical support.

201
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,503
The flight from Kochi
will land at 2:00 p.m.

202
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:35,589
Don't take a detour to eat Vada Pav.

203
00:12:37,007 --> 00:12:38,091
No, sir.

204
00:12:38,258 --> 00:12:39,676
Sir, he's the one fond of it.

205
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,136
I only give him company.

206
00:12:42,179 --> 00:12:43,305
Okay, sir.

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,935
Sir, about the home loan...

208
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:52,272
-Can we talk about this later?
-I was just asking, sir.

209
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,399
I have informed HR...

210
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:55,942
to prioritize your case.

211
00:12:56,026 --> 00:12:58,028
When there's an update, I'll tell you.

212
00:12:58,111 --> 00:12:59,404
Okay, sir. Thank you, sir.

213
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,239
There's a junior analyst
joining us today,

214
00:13:01,323 --> 00:13:02,365
transferred from IB.

215
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,783
One of you do the orientation.

216
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,285
-Okay--
-I'll do it, sir!

217
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:08,914
Okay, sir.
Thank you, sir.

218
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,169
The recruit!

219
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,172
That's why you were so keen!

220
00:13:17,923 --> 00:13:20,300
Have some shame, Talpade.
She's a new recruit.

221
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:21,801
Don't be jealous, Tiwari.

222
00:13:21,968 --> 00:13:23,637
It's injurious to your health.

223
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:26,431
Welcome to Threat Analysis
and Surveillance Cell.

224
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:27,432
We report to the NIA

225
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:29,267
and we work
in close coordination with RAW

226
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,268
and Force One.

227
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,230
Our main job, of course, is to
predict attacks before they happen.

228
00:13:33,438 --> 00:13:35,232
As you can see, we keep
a very low profile.

229
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:36,566
We track everything.

230
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:40,111
From social media posts,
to chat messages. Everything.

231
00:13:41,696 --> 00:13:44,324
The algorithm filters any
suspicious activities

232
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,784
anything, anyone

233
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,744
that could be a
potential terror threat.

234
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:50,288
Privacy is a myth,
just like democracy.

235
00:13:52,123 --> 00:13:53,250
Although there are some apps

236
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,710
which we haven't been able to
track, like Telegram.

237
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,671
What about the dark net?

238
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,673
Most of the threats
are found there, right?

239
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:00,924
Correct.

240
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,884
Nice.

241
00:14:03,218 --> 00:14:05,262
-Do you have a boyfriend?
-What?

242
00:14:05,512 --> 00:14:06,930
Do you have a boyfriend?

243
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,641
-Sir, why is that relevant?
-Very relevant!

244
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,561
Only those, whom we trust the most

245
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:14,646
can know about our work.

246
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:15,730
Of course, sir.

247
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,941
I have been briefed about this
by the department.

248
00:14:18,024 --> 00:14:19,943
-I'm sure I can--
-I know.

249
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,778
I was just reiterating
an important point.

250
00:14:22,028 --> 00:14:23,113
Of course, sir.

251
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:24,406
Call me JK.

252
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,658
-Of course, Mr. JK.
-Just JK.

253
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,035
-Of course, JK.
-Okay.

254
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,079
-Shall we?
-After you.

255
00:14:32,038 --> 00:14:34,082
-Would you like some tea?
-No, thank you.

256
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:39,796
And this is senior analyst,
Srikant Tiwari.

257
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:43,675
The Srikant Tiwari?

258
00:14:44,092 --> 00:14:45,051
"The"?

259
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:46,553
What have I done now?

260
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:48,346
Sir, we have heard
a lot about you.

261
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,598
Your work in the field

262
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,725
is still used as a case study
in the academy.

263
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,519
It's so good to
meet you in person, sir.

264
00:14:54,769 --> 00:14:55,812
Where are you from?

265
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,314
Sir, I am Zoya from Lucknow.

266
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:01,192
How one misses the
grand attractions of Lucknow!

267
00:15:01,484 --> 00:15:03,320
The food there is delicious!

268
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:06,489
I am Srikant Tiwari,
originally from Banaras.

269
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,825
-Nice to meet you, sir.
-How did you land here?

270
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:11,620
It just happened, sir.
I was pursuing engineering.

271
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:13,455
One day, I realized it wasn't for me.

272
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:14,873
So I switched careers.

273
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:17,000
And you landed in Intelligence.

274
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:19,794
It's a long story.
I'll share it some other time.

275
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,922
Well, you'll get to learn
a lot from him.

276
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:27,385
He's got two lovely kids,
and a very beautiful wife!

277
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:29,763
-Shall we?
-Sure.

278
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,140
-Would you like to join us?
-Me?

279
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:35,101
You will get to learn
from an expert and a veteran.

280
00:15:35,226 --> 00:15:36,353
Shall we go?

281
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,370
-Srikant Tiwari.
-Hello.

282
00:15:53,453 --> 00:15:54,287
JK Talpade.

283
00:15:54,371 --> 00:15:55,205
-Hi.
-Hello.

284
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,456
-Zoya.
-Hi.

285
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:59,292
-From TASC.
-Imran Pasha, Force One.

286
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:01,252
Have you been newly posted in Mumbai?

287
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,296
Yes, I was with the NSG.

288
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,465
The flight is delayed.

289
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:06,841
Please wait there.

290
00:16:07,008 --> 00:16:10,303
It's my responsibility to safely
deliver those three to you.

291
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:13,056
So just stay out
of my way, please.

292
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:15,767
Okay.

293
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:22,607
What's his problem?

294
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:23,942
Forget about it.

295
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,819
Does he think he's Rambo?

296
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,070
Ignore.

297
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:29,698
Just tell him,
we are field agents.

298
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,907
We aren't here to...

299
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,993
Let it be. Come on!

300
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,048
Thank you.

301
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,346
What?

302
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,640
Asshole.

303
00:16:56,599 --> 00:16:58,393
I hope the sugar's okay.

304
00:16:58,560 --> 00:16:59,769
Mr. Srikant Tiwari?

305
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:01,688
We are calling from 
 Saint Archer's School.

306
00:17:01,771 --> 00:17:03,523
This is regarding 
 your daughter, Dhriti.

307
00:17:04,399 --> 00:17:05,400
Yes, tell me.

308
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,235
-Your daughter--
-Can I please talk to him?

309
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,658
Dad, can you please
come here immediately?

310
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:17,746
-But what happened?
-Nothing.

311
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:21,207
They are just creating a ruckus
over a little tablet.

312
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:22,584
Tablet? What tablet?

313
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:25,920
-It's an anti-spasmodic tablet.
-What?

314
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,631
-Why?
 -Dad!

315
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,967
Anti-spasmodic tablet!

316
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,845
Okay, right.

317
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:36,514
Alright.
Don't worry, just relax.

318
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:41,019
-Did you call your mother?
-If I do, she'll scold me.

319
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:44,272
But how can I just leave?
I am busy!

320
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:47,817
You can't just call me
and expect me to show up.

321
00:17:47,901 --> 00:17:49,068
So, you are not coming?

322
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:52,489
Darling, it's just not 
 possible for me right now.

323
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:55,533
Your mom will handle this better.

324
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,702
Why don't you call her instead?

325
00:17:58,077 --> 00:17:59,621
She knows these kinds of things.

326
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,706
Dad, these people are going berserk.

327
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:03,875
They want to suspend me and shit.

328
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:07,712
Suspend?

329
00:18:09,297 --> 00:18:11,257
No. No way!

330
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:15,011
Stop whining! I'll be here
as soon as the flight lands.

331
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:16,888
And I'll do the paperwork alone?

332
00:18:17,263 --> 00:18:19,307
You've already started
working alone, haven't you?

333
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,143
Enjoy your coffee.

334
00:18:33,071 --> 00:18:34,113
Tell me the truth.

335
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,366
You haven't taken any
dubious tablets, have you?

336
00:18:36,491 --> 00:18:39,202
Dad, my stomach is hurting!

337
00:18:40,286 --> 00:18:41,412
Really?

338
00:18:41,579 --> 00:18:43,581
Okay. Sit down.

339
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,625
I'll handle it, don't worry.

340
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,335
-Mr. Tiwari.
-Yes, ma'am.

341
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:49,504
This is not like
any other school.

342
00:18:49,671 --> 00:18:53,174
In this school, we take
discipline very seriously.

343
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,009
-Yes, ma'am.
-If we are not disciplined

344
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:57,303
how are we different from animals?

345
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,934
Yes, you are absolutely right, Sister.

346
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,770
Yes, we take our
rules very strictly.

347
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:11,359
This is not a light matter that
we are discussing, Mr. Tiwari.

348
00:19:11,526 --> 00:19:13,027
Very sorry, Sister.

349
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:15,530
I left an important meeting midway--

350
00:19:15,613 --> 00:19:17,824
What is more important...

351
00:19:17,907 --> 00:19:19,576
than raising your daughter?

352
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,092
They are here.

353
00:19:54,903 --> 00:19:58,197
Your daughter was caught
consuming this tablet, Mr. Tiwari.

354
00:19:58,406 --> 00:19:59,782
Do you know what it is?

355
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,369
I am sorry, Sister.

356
00:20:03,786 --> 00:20:05,371
Yes, it's...

357
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:07,832
an anti-spasmodic tablet.

358
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,584
That's what she says.

359
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,461
Do you know really know what this is?

360
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,212
Is it prescribed?

361
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,131
I understand your concern, Sister.

362
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:17,008
But Dhriti is not
that kind of a girl.

363
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,260
She's a very good girl.

364
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,679
-And I know my daughter.
-"I know my daughter"?

365
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:25,224
Your daughter comes to my
school five days in a week.

366
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:28,728
How much time do you spend
with her, Mr. Tiwari?

367
00:20:31,773 --> 00:20:33,399
I am sorry, Sister.

368
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:39,989
My colleague JK,
is suffering from clinical depression.

369
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,116
He recently got divorced.

370
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,411
He's unable to come to terms with it.

371
00:20:45,703 --> 00:20:47,497
And he's very introverted.

372
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,375
He doesn't open up to people.

373
00:20:52,335 --> 00:20:54,003
That's why he keeps calling me.

374
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:58,049
And I fear that
if I don't answer his calls...

375
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,301
he might commit suicide.

376
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:05,306
Yes.

377
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:07,308
What were you saying, Sister?

378
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:18,361
Sir, I am not a terrorist.

379
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,822
I am just a computer engineer.

380
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,116
I haven't done anything, sir.

381
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,790
If my mother finds out...

382
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,250
she'll die of shock, sir.

383
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,334
Please, let me go.

384
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,629
Shut up!
Don't beg to these infidels, you dog!

385
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,589
You there, shut up!

386
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:43,302
I know what you're thinking.

387
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,847
"What are we doing?
What's the point of it all?

388
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,390
Anybody could do this."

389
00:21:47,473 --> 00:21:50,309
-No, I wasn't thinking--
-No! You're right.

390
00:21:50,393 --> 00:21:51,644
This is not our job.

391
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:54,272
This handover is supposed
to be a Force One operation.

392
00:21:55,106 --> 00:21:58,067
But it is important
for us to be here...

393
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:00,695
to supervise.

394
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,990
Supervision is very critical.

395
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,326
Son of a bitch!

396
00:23:16,104 --> 00:23:17,146
Shit!

397
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:33,579
Shit! They are gone!

398
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,998
-We need backup.
-Get on top!

399
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:44,841
Sir, they are heading
towards the slums.

400
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:50,555
Since this is her first offense...

401
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:54,350
and the classmate
didn't take the tablet...

402
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,354
I might go lenient on Dhriti
this one time.

403
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,566
Mr. Tiwari.
Don't make me explain this

404
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:03,109
-all over again--
-Fuck!

405
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:04,527
I have to go!

406
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:08,239
JK is on the terrace.
He said he'll jump.

407
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:10,408
-Mr. Tiwari--
-Sister, please try and understand.

408
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,660
I have to go and stop him, please!

409
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,245
Are you serious?

410
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,413
What about your daughter?

411
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:17,415
I'll have to suspend her, Mr. Tiwari!

412
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:19,625
Please let me go.

413
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:21,627
We'll talk about the suspension tomorrow.

414
00:24:21,711 --> 00:24:24,088
Okay? Please try and understand.

415
00:24:24,547 --> 00:24:27,008
-She's in the mood to suspend you today.
-What?

416
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:28,259
But you were supposed to help me!

417
00:24:28,342 --> 00:24:29,177
What did you do?

418
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,137
Don't worry.
I'll handle everything tomorrow.

419
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,640
And tell your mother that the
principal was in a horrible mood!

420
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:36,976
No, I am not going
to lie to her.

421
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:38,644
What?

422
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,898
You're not going to lie?

423
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:44,358
And what about
all the lies I tell her to save you?

424
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:49,071
Just wait till your mother
finds out about this!

425
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,282
You don't know what's
in store for you!

426
00:24:51,365 --> 00:24:52,700
I'll be back.

427
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,383
They must be hiding
somewhere in here.

428
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,427
They have guns.

429
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:12,970
Don't think twice. Just shoot.

430
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,597
-Okay, sir.
-Give me your gun.

431
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:18,684
Shoot to kill.

432
00:25:23,356 --> 00:25:24,482
Okay, sir.

433
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:38,371
Go upstairs! Go!

434
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,840
Get inside! Inside!

435
00:25:52,468 --> 00:25:53,928
Up! Upstairs!

436
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,895
Yes, sir.

437
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:45,646
I spotted them.
They are going towards the church.

438
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,946
Asif Bhai, listen to me!

439
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,364
Shut up!

440
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,282
I don't want to die unnecessarily!

441
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:21,409
Will you shut up?

442
00:28:21,492 --> 00:28:23,285
Let me talk to them.
We can surrender.

443
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:25,162
-We can surrender.
-They're trying to kill us!

444
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,331
Take it! Or I'll kill you!

445
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,541
Asif Bhai...

446
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:38,801
Let us get out of here.

447
00:29:22,928 --> 00:29:24,346
Move it! Hurry!

448
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,440
Move away!

449
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,002
Can you see him?

450
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:39,630
If you get a clear shot, take it.

451
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,259
-Come, "The" Srikant Tiwari!
-Sorry, man.

452
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,927
Pasha's lost it!

453
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,595
He's killing them all, one by one.

454
00:30:46,762 --> 00:30:48,597
He's already killed two.

455
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,893
How much time more?
I need backup!

456
00:30:53,394 --> 00:30:54,562
Fast!

457
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:57,565
Pasha!

458
00:30:58,440 --> 00:30:59,525
You want to kill them all?

459
00:30:59,608 --> 00:31:01,235
We need them alive!

460
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,071
If we hadn't killed them,
we'd all be dead by now.

461
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:05,281
Let us do our job!

462
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:07,116
TASC is a part of this operation.

463
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:10,202
-It's not yours alone.
-Those fuckers killed my boys!

464
00:31:10,286 --> 00:31:12,454
That doesn't mean you kill everybody.

465
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:15,249
Who the hell will we interrogate?

466
00:31:20,254 --> 00:31:21,380
Stand down.

467
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:24,842
But if he shoots even once...

468
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:27,845
I will go inside and shoot his head off.

469
00:31:28,429 --> 00:31:29,680
Backup on the way, sir.

470
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,981
What's his name?

471
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,610
-I'm not sure--
-Sir, Moosa. Moosa Rahman.

472
00:31:42,776 --> 00:31:44,653
The one who got shot
first was Aboobacker.

473
00:31:44,737 --> 00:31:46,363
The other one is Asif, their leader.

474
00:31:49,533 --> 00:31:50,993
Moosa!

475
00:31:54,997 --> 00:31:56,498
Moosa Rahman!

476
00:31:57,124 --> 00:31:58,584
That's your name, right?

477
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,419
Put your hands in the air...

478
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,172
and come out.

479
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,009
Do you understand Hindi?

480
00:32:10,054 --> 00:32:11,722
I haven't done anything!

481
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:13,724
I didn't start all of this.

482
00:32:14,016 --> 00:32:16,685
Listen, Moosa, both your friends...

483
00:32:16,852 --> 00:32:18,520
have been killed.

484
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:20,689
If you want to stay alive

485
00:32:20,773 --> 00:32:23,567
put your hands in the air and come out!

486
00:32:24,151 --> 00:32:26,070
They are not my friends.

487
00:32:26,612 --> 00:32:28,489
I did not want any of this.

488
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,325
But Asif never fucking listened to me.

489
00:32:34,787 --> 00:32:37,039
I am just a computer engineer.

490
00:32:39,583 --> 00:32:41,502
I just wanted to get out of Syria

491
00:32:41,794 --> 00:32:43,921
and go back home, to my mother.

492
00:32:45,464 --> 00:32:47,091
I just want to go
back to my mother!

493
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:49,259
Get some information on his mother.

494
00:32:50,844 --> 00:32:53,305
You want to go back to
your mother, right?

495
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:55,766
Then you shouldn't give it
a second thought!

496
00:32:56,392 --> 00:32:57,643
Surrender.

497
00:32:57,893 --> 00:33:02,272
I promise you,
I'll take you to your mother.

498
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,734
You bloody infidel!
I know what you will do.

499
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,195
As soon as I come out,
you will shoot me.

500
00:33:08,278 --> 00:33:09,488
Just like you shot
the other two.

501
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:12,866
No, that won't happen.
I give you my word.

502
00:33:13,033 --> 00:33:15,327
I don't trust you at all!

503
00:33:15,411 --> 00:33:17,538
You don't trust me, right?

504
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,750
But... I trust you.

505
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:25,337
I will leave this pistol behind
and come to you.

506
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:30,342
Got it? I am coming.

507
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:34,263
Are you crazy, you bloody idiot?

508
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:37,391
-I know what I am doing.
-Balls!

509
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:40,310
-Why are you becoming the bait?
-So what do I do?

510
00:33:40,394 --> 00:33:43,021
If I don't go in there and talk to him

511
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:46,191
that fucker standing behind you
will blow his brains out.

512
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,402
What if that asshole shoots you?

513
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,126
Why do you always
think negative, fucker?

514
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,504
Just pray to Lord Ganesha
that nothing happens to me.

515
00:34:07,963 --> 00:34:10,007
-Hail Lord Ganesha.
-Hail him!

516
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,008
Exactly.

517
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,387
Look, Moosa.

518
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:20,017
I'm leaving my gun behind.

519
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,316
Look, I am unarmed.

520
00:34:27,649 --> 00:34:28,776
All right?

521
00:34:28,901 --> 00:34:31,195
I am trusting you with my life!

522
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:35,407
My colleagues think I'm a moron,
for doing this.

523
00:34:35,491 --> 00:34:36,366
Shit!

524
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,411
Don't shoot me accidentally.

525
00:34:40,913 --> 00:34:42,247
May I come in?

526
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,374
Hail Lord Ganesha!

527
00:34:44,792 --> 00:34:46,126
Close the door!

528
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,711
Shit, shit!

529
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:51,215
I am the only one who wants you alive.

530
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:52,716
Moosa...

531
00:34:52,883 --> 00:34:55,260
-you need to see a doctor urgently!
-Shut up!

532
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,473
I know you are not like the other two.

533
00:34:59,723 --> 00:35:01,016
I know you are not a terrorist.

534
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,310
-I haven't done anything!
-I know!

535
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,854
But... my mother will think...

536
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,440
The poor thing.

537
00:35:10,943 --> 00:35:12,861
How will I face her?

538
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,114
She will die of shame...

539
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,409
when she finds out that...

540
00:35:19,535 --> 00:35:22,955
Moosa, you are losing a lot of blood.

541
00:35:23,288 --> 00:35:24,331
If you don't do
anything about it,

542
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,791
it won't be good for you.

543
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:27,960
Moosa, let me take you to a hospital.

544
00:35:28,043 --> 00:35:29,253
Don't you dare!

545
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,921
-Moosa.
-Don't you come near me.

546
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,882
Do you really think
I don't know what's going on?

547
00:35:34,049 --> 00:35:35,509
Don't come near me.

548
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:36,760
All right.

549
00:35:56,989 --> 00:35:59,241
Please, Moosa.
Please.

550
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,286
Believe me...

551
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:07,124
I know exactly what you're going through.

552
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,626
I was in Nagaland.

553
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:13,297
I got the news my mother was very ill.

554
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:18,927
By the time I came home,
she had already been cremated.

555
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:23,056
I didn't get to see my mother
when she was dying, Moosa.

556
00:36:23,515 --> 00:36:26,310
The mother used work as a maidservant

557
00:36:26,685 --> 00:36:30,230
and toil all day,
doing menial labor

558
00:36:30,355 --> 00:36:33,400
so that her son could study
and achieve something in life.

559
00:36:33,859 --> 00:36:36,528
But her son wasn't present
when she was breathing her last.

560
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,531
I do and I will regret it...

561
00:36:39,865 --> 00:36:41,909
for the rest of my life.

562
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:48,457
Moosa, for me it's my country.

563
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,295
For you, it's jihad.

564
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:56,882
It is important.

565
00:36:58,258 --> 00:36:59,968
But it's a mother we're talking about.

566
00:37:01,428 --> 00:37:05,807
And your mother...
would rather see you alive than dead.

567
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:24,409
Moosa, come out.

568
00:37:29,623 --> 00:37:31,083
Hey, gun down!

569
00:37:31,333 --> 00:37:32,584
Stand down!

570
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:45,555
Give me a soda.

571
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,432
One for me too.

572
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,230
How did you convince him to surrender?

573
00:37:56,525 --> 00:37:58,276
The same old...

574
00:37:58,860 --> 00:37:59,987
"Mother."

575
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:01,530
Killed your mother again?

576
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:03,365
I can't help it.

577
00:38:03,448 --> 00:38:05,784
The "mother" sentiment
really is something.

578
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:09,705
I think I should get a ritual done
for my mother's well-being.

579
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:14,084
When your mother finds out that
you kill her every other day...

580
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:16,044
she'll perform your last rites!

581
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:19,214
How are they doing?

582
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,551
Sir, Aboobacker is dead and Asif
is in a very critical condition.

583
00:38:24,136 --> 00:38:25,429
How was your first day?

584
00:38:26,221 --> 00:38:28,849
-First day!
-She's learnt a lot today.

585
00:38:29,182 --> 00:38:30,142
Of course, sir.

586
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:31,893
Sir, you were
absolutely unbelievable.

587
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,187
The way you handled
Moosa Rahman, that was...

588
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,064
-Thank you.
-Excuse me.

589
00:38:36,189 --> 00:38:38,275
You need to handle the wife now.

590
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:40,736
That's important as well.

591
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,612
Yes, Suchi.

592
00:38:42,738 --> 00:38:44,698
When are you going to 
 pick up the kids from school?

593
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,825
I am there.
At the gate, I mean.

594
00:38:47,034 --> 00:38:48,201
Which gate?

595
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,870
The school gate.

596
00:38:50,537 --> 00:38:51,455
Atharv!

597
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:56,418
Dhriti!
I can see the kids.

598
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,296
I have already picked them up.

599
00:38:59,379 --> 00:39:01,757
If you have more children,
please tell me their names.

600
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,550
Tomorrow, I'll pick them up too!

601
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,888
How about a drink?

602
00:39:08,555 --> 00:39:10,307
There's going to be
a world war at home.

603
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:12,976
If guns are going to be fired,
you need one.

604
00:39:13,393 --> 00:39:15,228
It will act as a bulletproof jacket.

605
00:39:47,302 --> 00:39:48,720
Major Sameer is coming.

606
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,289
Faizan Bhai.

607
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,500
I hope you liked the
arrangements we've made.

608
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:19,876
Of course!

609
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,254
You have made
excellent arrangements.

610
00:40:24,047 --> 00:40:25,757
General Ansari sends his regards.

611
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:26,800
Wa alaykumu as-salam.

612
00:40:26,883 --> 00:40:29,719
Please thank him for his hospitality.

613
00:40:30,011 --> 00:40:30,887
Of course.

614
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,141
How did the Americans find out
that I'm not in Syria?

615
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:36,476
Word gets around, Faizan Bhai.

616
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,272
The situation is bad in Islamabad.

617
00:40:40,856 --> 00:40:43,984
The Prime Minister is trying
hard to impress the Americans.

618
00:40:44,151 --> 00:40:46,736
It will be better if you lie low.

619
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:49,322
-What do you mean?
-Don't worry.

620
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:51,658
We are here for your protection.

621
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:54,286
The Americans won't find you
as long as we're around.

622
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:57,164
The CIA has announced
a million-dollar reward for my capture.

623
00:40:58,081 --> 00:40:59,708
And you say I shouldn't worry?

624
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,001
I...

625
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:09,593
-Please have some.
-Let's talk outside. Come.

626
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,221
The mujahid you sent from Syria

627
00:41:13,305 --> 00:41:15,265
was captured in India.

628
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,474
What?

629
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:18,977
Unfortunately, their boat was
spotted by the coast guard.

630
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,146
-Is he a martyr now?
-No.

631
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:23,106
That is the problem.

632
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:25,609
What do you want from me?

633
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:27,277
We need another mujahid...

634
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:29,529
who's already in India.

635
00:41:30,447 --> 00:41:32,908
First, you need to tell me
about the mission.

636
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:36,828
It's a top-secret mission, bhai.

637
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,955
Only a few know about it.

638
00:41:39,039 --> 00:41:41,458
Then include me among them, Major.

639
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:47,547
India has never retaliated
to Pakistan's provocations

640
00:41:47,672 --> 00:41:49,341
with a major assault.

641
00:41:49,716 --> 00:41:50,800
We got the parliament attacked.

642
00:41:50,884 --> 00:41:52,302
There was 26/11...

643
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:54,596
but the Indian government is fast asleep.

644
00:41:54,763 --> 00:41:56,097
It's time to wake them up.

645
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,515
We'll make the Indians...

646
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,310
scream for revenge.

647
00:42:01,102 --> 00:42:03,271
It'll be clearly construed
as an act of war.

648
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:07,442
The Indian government will have
to declare war on Pakistan.

649
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:10,820
This war will enable us to
conduct a coup in Pakistan.

650
00:42:12,155 --> 00:42:13,782
It's time...

651
00:42:13,907 --> 00:42:16,493
that Pakistan shows its
strength to the world.

652
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,663
That's why we have
named the mission

653
00:42:19,746 --> 00:42:21,748
Mission Zulfiqar.

654
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:22,916
Wonderful!

655
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:25,460
The name of the sacred sword!

656
00:42:25,794 --> 00:42:27,337
Does Islamabad know about this?

657
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:29,089
No.

658
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,134
I have all the details for this mission.

659
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:35,637
The ones who are going to
fulfill this mission

660
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,431
know only about their
particular tasks.

661
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:40,392
There's a young man...

662
00:42:41,268 --> 00:42:43,311
who's destined to carry this out.

663
00:42:43,436 --> 00:42:46,773
But it's a bit difficult to tame him.

664
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:49,484
In Intelligence lingo, he's a lone wolf.

665
00:42:51,069 --> 00:42:53,321
He's overwhelmingly passionate.

666
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,908
He wages jihad in his own style.

667
00:42:57,784 --> 00:42:59,911
He's preparing for something as we speak.

668
00:43:06,459 --> 00:43:08,503
We can recruit him for this mission.

669
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,088
He'll listen to me.

670
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:13,091
Then it's time to send him a message.

671
00:43:14,801 --> 00:43:16,052
Talpade, look at this.

672
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,222
This place costs 14,000 rupees
per square foot.

673
00:43:19,681 --> 00:43:22,976
It has a gym and
a swimming pool as well.

674
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,602
The cost is 16,000 rupees
in other buildings.

675
00:43:24,728 --> 00:43:26,646
-That's good.
-It's a good deal, right?

676
00:43:26,730 --> 00:43:28,023
It's good.

677
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:30,483
But I don't understand this obsession.

678
00:43:30,650 --> 00:43:32,485
-What?
-Of buying a house!

679
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:33,945
This is Mumbai!

680
00:43:34,863 --> 00:43:36,281
What do you get here for a house?

681
00:43:36,448 --> 00:43:37,615
A bloody matchbox!

682
00:43:37,866 --> 00:43:39,492
You become a bloody matchstick inside!

683
00:43:39,576 --> 00:43:41,369
I say rent is a wiser option.

684
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,246
Your math makes no sense...

685
00:43:44,331 --> 00:43:46,666
when it comes to emotions.

686
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:51,254
A man should have something
that he can call his own.

687
00:43:51,963 --> 00:43:53,798
Something Suchi and the kids
can call home.

688
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:56,801
Suchi is always so busy
handling the house.

689
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:59,804
And even if I want to,
I just can't help her.

690
00:44:00,305 --> 00:44:02,265
I can't stop working, right?

691
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:06,019
And if a man can't even leave
behind a house, then it's...

692
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:08,938
Don't talk about dying, man!

693
00:44:09,064 --> 00:44:10,690
It's a fact.

694
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:14,736
In our line of work,
we can't predict when we're gonna die.

695
00:44:14,903 --> 00:44:16,613
How long will I lie to Suchi?

696
00:44:16,696 --> 00:44:18,990
That all I do is
pass files around in the office.

697
00:44:19,199 --> 00:44:20,784
That I don't work on the field
or take risks.

698
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:22,035
You know what you need?

699
00:44:22,285 --> 00:44:23,495
Don't say Bangkok.

700
00:44:23,578 --> 00:44:25,288
Let's do a surgical strike
in Bangkok tonight--

701
00:44:25,372 --> 00:44:27,082
I said no Bangkok!

702
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,918
We'll enter at night,
and leave early in the morning.

703
00:44:30,085 --> 00:44:31,252
The mission will be a success

704
00:44:31,336 --> 00:44:33,046
and the enemy won't know what happened.

705
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:35,632
I'm telling you, Tiwari, you need this.

706
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:37,258
And betray Suchi?

707
00:44:37,342 --> 00:44:38,927
I'll advise her the same.

708
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,428
Even she should enjoy herself.

709
00:44:40,512 --> 00:44:42,013
Why should boys have all the fun?

710
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:43,807
Why not?

711
00:45:16,881 --> 00:45:18,341
That music can drive anybody crazy!

712
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,428
You scared me!

713
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,847
Dhriti has been suspended from school.

714
00:45:23,972 --> 00:45:25,014
What?

715
00:45:26,516 --> 00:45:28,393
What were you doing with those tablets?

716
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,728
Is that why we send you to school?

717
00:45:31,646 --> 00:45:34,399
And she was giving it
to other students as well.

718
00:45:34,774 --> 00:45:36,067
-What?
-Mom, I told you it was a--

719
00:45:36,151 --> 00:45:37,026
Shut up!

720
00:45:37,318 --> 00:45:38,611
Don't argue!

721
00:45:40,155 --> 00:45:42,073
You have an answer
for everything.

722
00:45:42,407 --> 00:45:44,492
Just like your dad.

723
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:45,910
One lie after another!

724
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:47,662
And you!

725
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,999
The principal was talking to you
and you just left!

726
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:52,709
No...

727
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,544
I needed to leave immediately.

728
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,546
How can you be so insensitive, Sri?

729
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:59,174
Do you have no interest
in your daughter's future?

730
00:45:59,299 --> 00:46:01,092
Of course, I do.

731
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:03,636
Then you wouldn't have
left in the first place.

732
00:46:03,887 --> 00:46:05,555
It was an emergency.

733
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,849
What is it with you and
your "emergencies"?

734
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:09,976
Come on, not again!

735
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:13,313
-Why don't you understand?
-Because I can't.

736
00:46:13,438 --> 00:46:15,315
Make me understand, I am listening.

737
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:16,524
Just a second.

738
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:19,277
HAS THE CIVIL WAR BEGUN?

739
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:23,406
IS THE BULLETPROOF JACKET WORKING?

740
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,408
-Go on, finish it.
-No, that's fine.

741
00:46:25,492 --> 00:46:28,036
I am sure it must be JK.
He's your first wife anyway.

742
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:29,954
He was asking about an important file.

743
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:33,833
Suchi! Please listen to me.

744
00:46:34,959 --> 00:46:36,169
If it wasn't important,

745
00:46:36,252 --> 00:46:39,130
I would've talked to
the principal all day.

746
00:46:40,048 --> 00:46:42,592
But there was a routine handover
at the airport, that's why...

747
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:47,347
Actually, there was a quarterly
meeting in the office.

748
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,932
The boss had flown down from Delhi.

749
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,184
Then, I was bombarded with phone calls

750
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:53,603
because they couldn't find
a file for the meeting.

751
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:57,232
I had to leave.
Otherwise, why would I go?

752
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,359
What were you saying about the airport?

753
00:47:00,527 --> 00:47:01,653
What airport?

754
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:06,157
-Did I say "airport"?
-I am tired, Sri!

755
00:47:06,241 --> 00:47:08,284
There's something important
at work every day!

756
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,203
But your family's important as well.

757
00:47:10,286 --> 00:47:11,704
Come on, I know that.

758
00:47:11,788 --> 00:47:15,416
You will go to Dhriti's school
and fix the situation tomorrow!

759
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,460
I promise, I will fix it.

760
00:47:17,919 --> 00:47:19,837
I really hope it's not
your field work again.

761
00:47:19,921 --> 00:47:21,172
Of course not, Suchi.

762
00:47:21,297 --> 00:47:22,340
Dad...

763
00:47:23,299 --> 00:47:24,676
can you guess the song?

764
00:47:26,302 --> 00:47:29,138
We are wasting our money
on this little chimp.

765
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:30,932
Listen, son!

766
00:47:31,057 --> 00:47:32,433
No more music classes for you.

767
00:47:32,517 --> 00:47:34,143
We did not give birth to you.

768
00:47:34,644 --> 00:47:36,604
You came into this world by accident!

769
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,025
Put that aside, right now.

770
00:47:44,195 --> 00:47:46,698
After so many classes! Useless!

771
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:49,951
Feeling better?

772
00:47:53,454 --> 00:47:54,831
I hope you know...

773
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:57,000
if you ever want to talk
about anything

774
00:47:57,083 --> 00:47:59,168
I am here for you.

775
00:48:02,005 --> 00:48:04,841
Like I said before,
you are a big girl now.

776
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:08,344
You should consider me your best friend.

777
00:48:08,928 --> 00:48:10,805
And what's the first rule of friendship?

778
00:48:11,681 --> 00:48:13,391
No more secrets.

779
00:48:16,102 --> 00:48:18,146
You call yourself our "best friend."

780
00:48:18,313 --> 00:48:21,316
But whenever you want,
you turn into a mother!

781
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,652
Why are you still up?
Go to sleep.

782
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:25,820
You have ten seconds.

783
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,530
This is not best friend behavior.
