1
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,369
Say something, Doctor!

2
00:00:35,828 --> 00:00:37,747
How many cigarettes
do you smoke in a day?

3
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,541
I smoke only when I'm stressed.

4
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,710
And how often are you stressed?

5
00:00:50,509 --> 00:00:51,802
And drinks?

6
00:00:52,762 --> 00:00:53,888
Well...

7
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:56,432
once in a while.

8
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,851
Sometimes, you know...

9
00:00:59,685 --> 00:01:00,936
two, maybe three.

10
00:01:01,437 --> 00:01:03,564
At the most, four or five.

11
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,857
In a week?

12
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:08,068
Daily?

13
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,115
-And meat?
-Absolutely not.

14
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,952
My family is vegetarian, Doctor.

15
00:01:17,369 --> 00:01:20,039
Whenever I eat out,
otherwise never.

16
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:22,500
And how often do you eat out?

17
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,339
Srikant, your blood sugar levels
are fluctuating again.

18
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:30,800
Do you still feel giddy sometimes?

19
00:01:30,883 --> 00:01:32,301
Do you keep chocolates with you?

20
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:36,597
Doctor, I eat more chocolates
than my kids do.

21
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,140
I always keep some with me.

22
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:40,142
-Do you want one?
-Look at your report!

23
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,102
Try keeping your cholesterol
under control.

24
00:01:42,228 --> 00:01:46,357
You have to quit eating meat,
fried food and smoking.

25
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:50,653
And one drink a day
should be the maximum.

26
00:01:50,945 --> 00:01:52,863
-And minimum?
-Do you not want to live?

27
00:01:52,947 --> 00:01:55,324
Come on, Doctor.
What's left to stay alive for?

28
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,952
-This is not a joke!
-I know, Doctor. But...

29
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,579
please stop scaring me.
I'll wet my pants.

30
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,748
And stop being so stressed out.

31
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,875
Take some small breaks in between.

32
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,002
Spend some time with your family.

33
00:02:07,086 --> 00:02:09,213
-Don't think about work--
-Just a second.

34
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,384
Yes, JK. What happened?

35
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,012
What?

36
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,098
Kala Ghoda?

37
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:20,516
I'll be right there!

38
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:23,102
-I haven't finished.
-I got it, sir.

39
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:25,855
I have to avoid drinking, smoking
fried food and stress.

40
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:27,189
Basically, I have to stop living.

41
00:02:27,273 --> 00:02:28,816
Why don't I just kill myself?

42
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:32,444
Move back! Come on!

43
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:34,572
Walking with my friends...

44
00:02:36,365 --> 00:02:37,950
Be very calm.

45
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,035
You know what you have to do.

46
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,495
-Put the jacket on him.
-Yes, sir.

47
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,913
Radio check, radio check.

48
00:02:42,997 --> 00:02:45,082
-Step aside.
-Move.

49
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,126
Please step aside.

50
00:02:47,793 --> 00:02:50,212
If the bomb goes off,
you'll get a great selfie

51
00:02:50,296 --> 00:02:52,256
of your bloody remains, moron.

52
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:53,674
-Move.
-Step aside.

53
00:02:55,009 --> 00:02:56,886
I'll be giving you
instructions over the radio.

54
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,971
Just follow them. Okay?

55
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:01,098
-Now get going.
-What the fuck is this?

56
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,975
At least give me a decent suit!

57
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:04,727
Quickly get some duct tape.

58
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,652
Did you check the
scooter's number plate?

59
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,237
-Whose name is it registered under?
-It's a fake.

60
00:04:01,116 --> 00:04:02,534
Chassis number?

61
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,370
Chassis number?

62
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,584
BDU. Come in, BDU.

63
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,753
-Who's at the scooter? 
-Chirayu.

64
00:04:12,878 --> 00:04:14,213
Chirayu, come in.

65
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:16,966
I need the chassis number.

66
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:18,968
What the fuck!

67
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:20,678
Do I look like a mechanic to you?

68
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,304
Please, just check it.

69
00:04:26,308 --> 00:04:27,893
It'll blast, fuck off!

70
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:29,812
Dumbass.

71
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:37,569
Write down the details.

72
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,072
There is no chassis number. 
 It's a stolen vehicle.

73
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,324
Not available.

74
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,284
Did you check the CCTV footage?

75
00:04:44,994 --> 00:04:46,412
CCTV...

76
00:04:49,248 --> 00:04:50,624
One minute.

77
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:57,339
Chirayu, if you have any doubts,
abort the mission.

78
00:04:57,423 --> 00:05:00,259
I repeat, if you're not sure, 
 just abort the mission. Over.

79
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,426
Fuck!

80
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:44,845
Give me a puff.

81
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,382
I need the CCTV footage from
all the cameras in the area.

82
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,801
Yeah, 9:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m.

83
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,219
Yeah, I'll hold. Sure.

84
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,720
Hey. Here you go.

85
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:36,271
Latest code names and transcripts,
please keep them in the data base.

86
00:06:36,605 --> 00:06:37,940
How did this happen?

87
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:39,817
How the hell did we miss this?

88
00:06:39,942 --> 00:06:43,237
The PM is asking the NIA why
we could not stop this attack.

89
00:06:44,279 --> 00:06:46,657
TASC was created...

90
00:06:47,116 --> 00:06:50,244
to prevent such attacks!

91
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,996
So, what the fuck went wrong?

92
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:56,125
Sir, this doesn't seem to be the work
of a sleeper cell.

93
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,252
It looks like a lone wolf's job.

94
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,170
A solo operation, sir.

95
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:02,798
Otherwise, something would've shown up
on the radar.

96
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:04,925
-We are investigating--
-Sir.

97
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:07,386
Sir, I think it's a one-off attack.

98
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,222
You better be sure.

99
00:07:10,305 --> 00:07:12,182
This is no bigger than you say it is.

100
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,976
Sir, I think it's not possible.

101
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,978
Sir, I think it's possible.

102
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:19,356
I'm sorry, sir.
But...

103
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,900
we need to thoroughly
investigate this, sir.

104
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,486
I need this report on the PM's desk,
tomorrow morning.

105
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:25,904
Do you understand?

106
00:07:26,196 --> 00:07:28,115
-Yes, sir.
-Sri, you guys can leave.

107
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:31,243
-Thank you, sir.
-Sharma, please sit down.

108
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,578
-And Sri.
-Yes, sir?

109
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:34,621
I want you to come with
me to the airport, please.

110
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:35,914
Of course, sir.

111
00:07:43,255 --> 00:07:45,632
How the hell did we miss this?

112
00:07:45,716 --> 00:07:48,635
We have all the
infrastructure in the world

113
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:50,429
and not even a single red flag?

114
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,139
Red flags only get raised

115
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:54,391
when the threat pattern
is more than 50%.

116
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,394
None of the threat patterns
were more than 50%.

117
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:00,689
Have you heard of this thing
called "human intelligence"?

118
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:04,651
How can we always fucking
depend on those stupid machines.

119
00:08:04,735 --> 00:08:06,320
Sri, I am on it.

120
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:26,423
Didn't the doctor ask you
to quit smoking?

121
00:08:33,555 --> 00:08:34,932
Give me a puff.

122
00:08:42,105 --> 00:08:46,568
Halfway into the year,
and we've already lost 42 lives.

123
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:49,821
Another such blast and...

124
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,866
the toll could reach a hundred.

125
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:05,003
Sir!

126
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:14,388
Hello, Doctor.
Srikant Tiwari, NIA.

127
00:09:14,471 --> 00:09:16,223
-Any progress?
-No progress.

128
00:09:16,306 --> 00:09:18,558
We don't know when he will
come out of coma

129
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:19,893
or if he ever will.

130
00:09:19,977 --> 00:09:22,980
But we're keeping his vitals stable
so that he stays alive.

131
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:37,911
I'm not hungry.

132
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:40,914
You'll recover only if you eat.

133
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:43,750
Medicines won't work
on an empty stomach.

134
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,836
The rest is up to you.

135
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,047
Where are you from?

136
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:53,427
Kottayam.

137
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:56,096
I'm from Kasaragod.

138
00:09:57,889 --> 00:10:00,517
How did you know I'm a Malayali?

139
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,686
I just guessed.

140
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:08,275
Did you grow up here,
or in your hometown?

141
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:11,820
I've been brought up in Mumbai.

142
00:10:12,612 --> 00:10:16,783
That's why my Malayalam
is not very good.

143
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,578
Just like my Hindi.

144
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,208
Sir, what are you doing?

145
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,669
You're not allowed here.
Please wait outside.

146
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,463
You're disturbing the patient.

147
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,423
I am from NIA.

148
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:32,883
-Oh.
-Yeah.

149
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:35,177
It's okay, Sister Mary.

150
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:36,970
-Mary, yes.
-Nice meeting you.

151
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:38,597
Don't worry.
I'll look after him.

152
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,639
-Okay.
-Yeah.

153
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,184
Bye, sister.

154
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:49,566
Moosa, my man!
Living the life!

155
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:52,277
Enjoying a luxurious stay, aren't you?

156
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:54,571
When people like me fall ill

157
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,491
we have to stand in long queues
in government hospitals.

158
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,203
But they've blocked
an entire ward just for you.

159
00:11:11,588 --> 00:11:12,631
Sir...

160
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,925
can I ask you something?

161
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:20,972
Easy.

162
00:11:22,724 --> 00:11:25,394
-Do you still regret it?
-Regret what?

163
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,729
That you couldn't see your
mother when she passed away.

164
00:11:37,781 --> 00:11:39,366
Of course.

165
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:45,414
I regret it every single day.

166
00:11:46,998 --> 00:11:51,086
I want to meet my mother.
Sir, please.

167
00:11:51,169 --> 00:11:53,088
I want the same for you.

168
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:56,633
But if the department
asks me how you're helping us,

169
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,218
and why am I being so nice to you,

170
00:11:58,301 --> 00:11:59,553
what will I say?

171
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:01,638
You help me and I assure you

172
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:03,640
that you will meet your mother.

173
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,308
That's my promise!

174
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:10,230
When did you join ISIS?

175
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:18,113
Three years ago...

176
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:21,491
I left Kasaragod.

177
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:25,704
Asif...

178
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,165
was already in Syria.

179
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:32,335
He arranged everything for me.

180
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:38,425
They had me handle their websites.

181
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:39,801
Websites?

182
00:12:40,719 --> 00:12:41,887
Yes.

183
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,597
What did you think?

184
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,517
They can't even stand
the sight of Indians.

185
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,688
They treat us the same way you do.

186
00:12:52,314 --> 00:12:55,650
Indian-Muslims don't even get
proper work out there.

187
00:12:56,818 --> 00:12:58,403
We get jobs like cleaning toilets...

188
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,780
sweeping and mopping.

189
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:04,493
If you're educated,
they put you on a computer.

190
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:06,077
Asif...

191
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,122
Wait, let me.

192
00:13:14,878 --> 00:13:15,962
Easy.

193
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,680
I was tired, sir.

194
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:29,226
I just wanted to
get out of that place.

195
00:13:29,935 --> 00:13:31,228
That's when I came to know

196
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,856
that Asif was planning
a mission in India.

197
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,818
I begged Asif to include me in it.

198
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:42,405
It was the only way
I could came back to India.

199
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:46,076
Did Asif ever mention
anything about the mission?

200
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,536
Whenever I asked him...

201
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:51,414
he'd say that something big
was going to happen.

202
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,291
Something big?

203
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,044
Anything else?
Try to remember.

204
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:58,713
No, he didn't tell me anything else.

205
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,508
Try to recall.
What big thing was he referring to?

206
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,260
What does it matter, sir?

207
00:14:03,552 --> 00:14:09,140
Now that Asif and Abu are no more
there will be no mission, right?

208
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:14,145
Asif is alive.

209
00:14:15,689 --> 00:14:17,148
He's in a coma.

210
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:20,694
He can regain consciousness
at any moment.

211
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:22,737
And once he does...

212
00:14:23,989 --> 00:14:25,907
we won't need you anymore.

213
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:30,370
We'll extract the information from him
one way or the other.

214
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:31,496
That's why I'm telling you,

215
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,416
think it through but hurry up.

216
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,750
Or else...

217
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:38,837
you can tell me
what I should say to your mother

218
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:40,547
once you go to jail.

219
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,300
Let me know.

220
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,062
Sir?

221
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,648
I've quit.

222
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,822
-How are Suchi and the kids?
-They are...

223
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:08,783
They're doing good, sir.

224
00:15:09,784 --> 00:15:12,203
I've trained you for three years.

225
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:17,125
I can tell when
you're lying to me, you know?

226
00:15:18,293 --> 00:15:21,379
It's nothing, sir.

227
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:25,675
It's just that Suchi thinks,
I should quit this job

228
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:27,761
and take up a private job.

229
00:15:27,886 --> 00:15:29,137
She makes sense.

230
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:33,391
There's more money, security
and less risk in a private job.

231
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:36,936
But never forget why you chose this job.

232
00:15:37,187 --> 00:15:38,188
Right, sir.

233
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:40,023
When I was in Nagaland...

234
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,819
I almost lost my life in an IED attack.

235
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:49,157
My wife was exasperated.
She told me to quit this job.

236
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,326
But after a lot of arguments,
I convinced her

237
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:54,913
that I would stop risking my life
and just do paperwork.

238
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,624
-What happened then, sir?
-What do you think?

239
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,752
She still thinks I do paperwork.

240
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,131
Back then, it wasn't very difficult
to convince people.

241
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,177
In those days, there was neither
social media, nor many TV channels.

242
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:10,720
There was just one channel.

243
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:13,556
I have been in your position.

244
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,561
Somebody has to step up
and do this job.

245
00:16:18,853 --> 00:16:21,022
When the country is safe...

246
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,567
only then can our families be safe.

247
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:29,072
I have a lot of expectations from you.

248
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,330
What did the doctor say?

249
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,249
Everything is fine.

250
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:42,752
Care to elaborate?

251
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,964
You know what they always say.

252
00:16:46,089 --> 00:16:47,757
The same damn thing, rephrased.

253
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:51,970
"Don't stress, control your sugar,
avoid eating fried food."

254
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:54,139
My sugar's already in control.
And I'll quit meat.

255
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,598
Everything will be fine.

256
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:58,893
What about your smoking and drinking?

257
00:16:58,977 --> 00:16:59,894
That's fine.

258
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:02,814
As long as it's in moderation.

259
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,483
Is that what the doctor said?

260
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:08,069
Doctors are never straightforward.

261
00:17:08,153 --> 00:17:10,572
Always beating around the bush.

262
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,449
But that's the gist of it.

263
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:15,702
Are you going to meet
Dhriti's principal tomorrow?

264
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,079
Or, as usual, I'll have to...

265
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,874
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

266
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,253
The flute's gone?

267
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,395
Major Sameer, what's this we
hear about Mission Zulfiqar?

268
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,939
With such a dismal start...

269
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:47,066
how do we trust you 
 to fulfill the mission?

270
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:49,277
How confident are we about
the success of this mission?

271
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,572
Don't you think we should
look at some alternatives?

272
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:54,449
Your doubts are justified, gentlemen.

273
00:17:54,991 --> 00:17:57,952
There have been a few hurdles.
But don't lose hope.

274
00:17:58,036 --> 00:18:00,205
We are going to succeed in this mission.

275
00:18:00,288 --> 00:18:03,374
We hope you're aware of
its importance, Major.

276
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:07,212
Mission Zulfiqar is important for us
and our country.

277
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,714
The future of our country and its people

278
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,468
depend entirely on the mission's success.

279
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:14,719
There was a time

280
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,304
when the very mention
of the Pakistani army

281
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:17,931
would make the Indians wet their pants.

282
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:20,767
But now those Indians cross the border,

283
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,270
enter our homes,
and carry out surgical strikes.

284
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:27,732
At this rate,
we'll not only lose Kashmir

285
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,360
but also Baluchistan.

286
00:18:30,485 --> 00:18:34,113
It's time that
Pakistan gets the respect

287
00:18:34,197 --> 00:18:36,282
it has always deserved in this world.

288
00:18:36,366 --> 00:18:38,076
I'll not disappoint you.

289
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:42,247
Mission Zulfiqar will succeed,
by hook or by crook.

290
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,123
Any news about our fighter?

291
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:45,542
He's in the hospital, sir.

292
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:47,043
But the good news is that

293
00:18:47,418 --> 00:18:50,672
the Indians are clueless about our plan.

294
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,425
Faizan has suggested another fighter.

295
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:57,178
-I've heard that he's a capable man.
-Very good.

296
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,557
But he's just carried out
a scooter blast in Mumbai.

297
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,478
And now the Indian authorities
must be on his trail.

298
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,313
You don't need to worry about that, sir.

299
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,233
I am monitoring their investigation.

300
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:15,154
I'll make sure they don't
find our fighter.

301
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,447
Be careful, Sameer.

302
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:19,826
We can't afford to make
any mistakes at this stage.

303
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:20,869
Sure, sir.

304
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:22,871
A toast to the
Islamic Republic of Pakistan!

305
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:24,706
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

306
00:19:29,752 --> 00:19:30,753
Just watch.

307
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:34,173
They'll waste the entire week
on deciding the curriculum.

308
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:35,133
Correct.

309
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:36,593
They won't even add anything new.

310
00:19:36,676 --> 00:19:38,511
It'll be the same outdated syllabus.

311
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,804
-Correct.
-I don't understand why

312
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,265
everyone feels compelled
to give some input.

313
00:19:43,349 --> 00:19:44,517
Stop laughing.

314
00:19:44,601 --> 00:19:47,145
-What do you care now?
-I didn't say a word.

315
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,272
Okay, listen.

316
00:19:50,148 --> 00:19:52,233
I have thought a lot about this.

317
00:19:53,318 --> 00:19:54,944
You've been doing this job
for nine years

318
00:19:55,028 --> 00:19:57,322
and you're good at it.
But you hate it.

319
00:19:57,405 --> 00:20:00,909
I know this job gives you
flexibility, security, benefits.

320
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,535
Even the pay scale is decent.

321
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:05,955
It has everything.
Except for one thing.

322
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,124
Challenges.

323
00:20:08,499 --> 00:20:10,752
You're the kind who
thrives on challenges.

324
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,921
Maybe you don't realize it.

325
00:20:13,046 --> 00:20:16,090
-I'll be straightforward--
-Come on, Arvind.

326
00:20:16,174 --> 00:20:19,552
Just quit this stupid job
and join our company.

327
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:21,179
You're getting a job
without an interview.

328
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:22,430
What more do you want?

329
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:24,140
Are you done?

330
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,894
I knew you'd come back to this topic.

331
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,437
And you know it's not happening.

332
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,522
-But--
-Let's go, I need to get to class!

333
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:34,400
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning, ma'am.

334
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,401
Good morning.

335
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:38,655
I hope you know this.

336
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:41,574
Some of the students here
think that we're a thing.

337
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:42,492
-What?
-Yes.

338
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:43,910
-No!
-Yes.

339
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:47,413
Really?

340
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:11,479
Go on.
Alright, stop.

341
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,106
That's it.

342
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:14,941
We have to demolish all of this.

343
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:17,235
-Right from here, all the way over there.
-Excuse me.

344
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,736
What's going on?

345
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,447
-Are you the principal?
-Yes.

346
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:23,157
Here's a notice for you.

347
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:26,995
We'd sent you a notice before
but you didn't respond to us.

348
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:29,163
This structure is illegal,
we need to demolish it.

349
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,957
We did not receive any such notice.

350
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,292
And please get rid
of this bulldozer.

351
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:35,420
Ma'am, we're just following the orders.

352
00:21:35,545 --> 00:21:38,464
If you have a problem,
please call up the BMC Commissioner.

353
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:41,175
Let me just do my job.
And shut the gate.

354
00:21:41,259 --> 00:21:42,468
We don't want the kids
to get in the way.

355
00:21:42,552 --> 00:21:44,262
Ask them to close that gate.

356
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:47,015
-Wait, wait!
-Ma'am, we have orders.

357
00:21:47,098 --> 00:21:48,891
-Hey, let's begin.
-Good morning, ma'am.

358
00:21:48,975 --> 00:21:50,935
Mr. Tiwari, please, not now!

359
00:21:51,185 --> 00:21:52,812
What's happening, buddy?

360
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:55,523
We're here to work, not explain
ourselves to everybody.

361
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:58,109
Step aside!
Take the vehicle ahead.

362
00:21:58,192 --> 00:21:59,318
Come on, tell me.

363
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:01,863
Mr. Tiwari, this does not
concern you, please!

364
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,489
Ma'am, let me just talk to him.

365
00:22:03,573 --> 00:22:04,949
What do you mean "talk to him"?

366
00:22:05,033 --> 00:22:06,325
I can also speak English, okay?

367
00:22:06,409 --> 00:22:07,910
-Let's get going.
-Mr. Tiwari.

368
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,704
Just a second, ma'am.

369
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,498
Don't you have any manners?

370
00:22:12,915 --> 00:22:15,752
-What?
-Don't mess with me.

371
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,463
I'm being respectful and so should you.

372
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:19,422
Hello!

373
00:22:19,505 --> 00:22:20,590
Shut that damn thing.

374
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,633
Or I'll come up there and thrash you.

375
00:22:22,717 --> 00:22:24,218
-Shut it!
-Mr. Tiwari.

376
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:25,928
Mr. Tiwari, why are you--

377
00:22:26,012 --> 00:22:28,347
Sister, please.
Let me talk to him.

378
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,640
Didn't you hear me?

379
00:22:29,724 --> 00:22:31,309
Shut the damn bulldozer!

380
00:22:31,392 --> 00:22:34,145
One phone call and
you'll be begging for forgiveness.

381
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:36,355
-Who are you?
-I am from the BMC.

382
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,648
Got it?

383
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,525
You want to call someone? Go ahead.

384
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,860
Go on, do it!

385
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:42,820
These days, you fine an idiot
a hundred rupees

386
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,238
and they dial the
Chief Minister's number!

387
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,907
There's nothing you can do.

388
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,575
This is the BMC Commissioner's order.

389
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,368
Step aside! Roll ahead!

390
00:22:49,660 --> 00:22:51,079
Are you done?

391
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,122
Who's your commissioner?

392
00:22:54,332 --> 00:22:56,042
Who's your commissioner?

393
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,794
Mhatre, right?

394
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,547
Do you know his full name?

395
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,550
GM Mhatre.

396
00:23:10,556 --> 00:23:12,225
What's up, Mhatre?

397
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,019
How are you?

398
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:18,481
Not at all.

399
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:21,275
I'm at my daughter's school right now.

400
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,569
Sir.

401
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:25,988
Sir.

402
00:23:27,782 --> 00:23:28,825
Sir.

403
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:31,577
Sorry, ma'am.

404
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,913
I didn't know that sir would...

405
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:36,082
They just told us that
we had to go to another school.

406
00:23:36,207 --> 00:23:37,792
-Another school?
-Yes.

407
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:40,211
Sorry, we had the orders so...

408
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:41,546
-Thank you, sir.
-Okay.

409
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:42,797
Get the vehicle out!

410
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,508
Thank you, Mr. Tiwari
for saving our school!

411
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,260
You don't need to thank me, ma'am.

412
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,178
It's my duty to help.

413
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:53,099
What are you looking at?
Apologize.

414
00:23:53,182 --> 00:23:54,559
I am sorry, ma'am.

415
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:56,936
I...

416
00:23:57,979 --> 00:23:59,689
I'll take your leave now.

417
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,859
I just wanted to know how long
will she be suspended for.

418
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:05,319
Oh, no. I'm going to
revoke her suspension.

419
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:07,572
No, no.
You don't need to do this, ma'am.

420
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,157
She should realize her mistake!

421
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,325
I think she's realized her mistake.

422
00:24:11,576 --> 00:24:14,495
Dhriti, you're very lucky
to have a father like him.

423
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,247
You should learn from him.

424
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,708
Now, could you excuse us
for two minutes?

425
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,959
Yes, sure.

426
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:23,713
-Mr. Tiwari.
-Yes, ma'am.

427
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,381
-This is a tender age.
-Yes.

428
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,593
And there are a lot of
bad influences around them.

429
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:31,596
You know, drugs, alcohol, cigarettes...

430
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:40,980
I hope my name didn't come up.

431
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,317
The principal did ask me.

432
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,694
But I told her it was my tablet.

433
00:24:48,029 --> 00:24:49,030
You're safe.

434
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,165
And then the guy was like...

435
00:24:59,248 --> 00:25:00,333
"Sir, step aside.”

436
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,751
And the principal was like,

437
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,711
"Mr. Tiwari, just stay out of it.”

438
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:04,879
And Dad was like, you know,

439
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,131
"Ma'am please be quiet.
Let me do the talking.”

440
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:09,091
Listen up, musical prodigy!

441
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:10,593
Your sister's saying something important.

442
00:25:10,676 --> 00:25:12,762
-I am listening, kind of.
-"Kind of!"

443
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,431
And then, Dad stopped him,

444
00:25:15,556 --> 00:25:18,100
called up somebody
and gave him the phone.

445
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:20,353
And you know what that
man said after the call?

446
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,063
"Sorry, sir. Sorry, ma'am."

447
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,065
And then he left with his bulldozer.

448
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,821
Tell them what happened next.

449
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:32,531
Shouldn't you tell the whole story?

450
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,159
Dad, don't push it, okay?

451
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:37,370
What do you mean?

452
00:25:37,662 --> 00:25:39,580
You should tell them the whole thing.

453
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:40,790
Alright.

454
00:25:40,915 --> 00:25:42,208
She can resume going to school, right?

455
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:44,377
Of course. No excuses.

456
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:46,337
Ma'am, hello!

457
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,798
After dinner, keep your schoolbag
and the uniform ready.

458
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,217
Don't look for your books
in the morning. Okay?

459
00:25:55,596 --> 00:25:57,556
You didn't blackmail them, did you?

460
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,935
-What do you mean?
-Well, you could have...

461
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:04,397
dug up old records and
threatened the poor Sister.

462
00:26:05,231 --> 00:26:07,233
Is that what you
think of your husband?

463
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,651
Don't act all innocent.

464
00:26:08,818 --> 00:26:10,486
I know how you get things done.

465
00:26:13,322 --> 00:26:14,198
Listen.

466
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:17,451
-I wanted to discuss something.
-Tell me.

467
00:26:18,953 --> 00:26:21,247
What if I quit this job and...

468
00:26:21,956 --> 00:26:23,958
try something new?

469
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:31,716
I mean, I've been doing the
same job for nine years.

470
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:32,925
Suchi...

471
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,469
people spend their entire
lives doing the same job.

472
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:36,512
I cannot take it anymore.

473
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:37,805
I am tired!

474
00:26:40,975 --> 00:26:42,977
Suchi, what's the problem?

475
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,396
It's a good job, you're back home in time

476
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,148
and you get to spend some
time with the kids as well.

477
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,274
What more do we want?

478
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:51,277
Is it just my responsibility
to spend time with the kids?

479
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,613
-That's not what I meant
-Remember what we had discussed?

480
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:58,034
That both of us will take
some time out for the kids

481
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,453
and equally share their responsibility.

482
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:04,290
Do you think I don't want
to spend time with them?

483
00:27:04,373 --> 00:27:06,876
You know the nature of my job!

484
00:27:08,252 --> 00:27:12,381
What's the point of such a job where
you don't have time for family?

485
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:15,009
Suchi, why are you doing this?

486
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:18,763
Sri, you told me that
you'll quit this job...

487
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,557
and look for something
where you won't be

488
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,434
slogging it out on the field.

489
00:27:23,517 --> 00:27:24,727
I don't do anything field-related.

490
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:27,271
I just pass around files
in the office all day!

491
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:30,649
-You know what the problem is?
-What?

492
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,526
You expect me

493
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,029
to be very understanding
about your job.

494
00:27:35,154 --> 00:27:39,033
But when it comes to me,
you have no empathy!

495
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,496
Have you ever asked me

496
00:27:43,913 --> 00:27:46,290
if I am happy with my job?

497
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:53,547
You know what?
I've made up my mind.

498
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,425
I want to try something new.
That's it.

499
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,260
I can't spend my whole life

500
00:27:58,344 --> 00:28:00,262
giving the same damn
lecture year after year.

501
00:28:00,346 --> 00:28:01,263
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:04,475
Sri?

503
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:06,852
Sri?

504
00:28:07,144 --> 00:28:08,729
-Sri!
-It's urgent.

505
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:10,856
I'll have to run!

506
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,410
-What's the alert?
-I'm patching you in. Take a look.

507
00:28:22,618 --> 00:28:24,829
There's a group on Facebook
called Almighty's Army.

508
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,831
We've been monitoring it 
 for quite some time now.

509
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,500
They've been orange-flagged 
 16 times in the last six months.

510
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:32,044
We've been monitoring 
 three members closely.

511
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:33,671
Arshad Dalal.

512
00:28:34,171 --> 00:28:36,424
Hussain Gudur 
 and Riyaz Younis.

513
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,509
They work for a gaming company.

514
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:39,802
Initek Games.

515
00:28:43,973 --> 00:28:46,976
All three of them have 
 been to Saudi together for hajj.

516
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,520
They also went to 
 Dubai for four days.

517
00:28:49,603 --> 00:28:52,648
And Hussain has recently applied 
 for a visa to Turkey.

518
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,525
-Turkey, the backdoor to Syria.
 -Yes.

519
00:28:54,608 --> 00:28:57,903
They were in constant touch
with the ISIS leads in Syria

520
00:28:57,987 --> 00:28:59,071
through video conferencing.

521
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:07,538
It is Allah's will 
 that we have the strength

522
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:09,832
to wage war against the infidels.

523
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,168
We are at war not with 
 one country but--

524
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,669
The first voice is from Syria.

525
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:16,297
Voice-print analysis shows
that this voice belongs to

526
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,174
a known online
recruiter from ISIS.

527
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,758
The second voice, 
 is from Pakistan.

528
00:29:19,842 --> 00:29:23,262
And Arshad, Hussain, 
 and Riyaz, were on this call.

529
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,347
How's this connected to the blast?

530
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,724
Here.

531
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:34,106
So what? A lot of people
celebrated that accident.

532
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,149
Yes, sir.

533
00:29:35,232 --> 00:29:37,193
But not before the news
made the headlines.

534
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:40,488
The news about the blast 
 broke out after an hour.

535
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:42,865
And there was no mention 
 of Kala Ghoda anywhere.

536
00:29:42,948 --> 00:29:46,410
But Riyaz put up this post

537
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,245
just ten minutes after the blast.

538
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,626
Team meeting. Twenty minutes.

539
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,586
-Right.
-Okay, sir.

540
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,799
Run along.

541
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,438
What do you think?

542
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:17,191
Is this evidence enough to arrest them?

543
00:30:17,483 --> 00:30:21,195
Sir, I think these boys are plain stupid.

544
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:23,739
They must've been brainwashed
about the glory of jihad

545
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:26,367
and now they're
running after Jannat.

546
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:31,580
But I'm sure they
knew about the plan.

547
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:35,251
And they can lead us
to the scooter bomber.

548
00:30:35,668 --> 00:30:39,421
Pasha, how much time will it take
for your team to get ready?

549
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:41,173
Won't take long, sir.

550
00:30:41,924 --> 00:30:42,967
What's your plan?

551
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:47,179
The plan is to catch the
three of them together, no matter what.

552
00:30:47,388 --> 00:30:50,391
Because if eve one of them finds out,
that the other has been caught

553
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:52,059
we'll end up with only one.

554
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:54,353
So, we need them all to be in one place.

555
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,479
That has to be in their office.

556
00:30:55,563 --> 00:30:57,398
Of course.
Let's go and wish them all

557
00:30:57,481 --> 00:30:58,566
a Happy New Year.

558
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:01,443
-But we'll have to be very careful.
-Yes, very careful.

559
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,736
This is the IT hub of the city.

560
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,738
We need to work very discreetly.

561
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,658
Unlike last time,
we cannot rain bullets on them.

562
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:10,077
Sir, I am not a barbarian.

563
00:31:10,744 --> 00:31:12,246
But if anybody fires at my men,

564
00:31:12,329 --> 00:31:13,581
I won't bow down in front of them.

565
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,832
Nobody's asking you to do that!

566
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,376
-But at least spare the civilians!
-Okay!

567
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:19,962
Is that possible?

568
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,298
-Yes, sir.
-Alright then.

569
00:31:22,464 --> 00:31:23,549
I don't want a commotion.

570
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,384
I want a simple,
in-and-out operation.

571
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,720
I don't want any media
attention on the case.

572
00:31:27,928 --> 00:31:29,096
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

573
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:31,724
I hope they don't know
that they are under surveillance.

574
00:31:31,807 --> 00:31:33,267
-Not at all, sir.
-Okay.

575
00:31:33,350 --> 00:31:35,227
Let's move on them, tomorrow...

576
00:31:35,311 --> 00:31:36,395
quietly.

577
00:31:36,562 --> 00:31:38,897
-Co-ordinate well.
-Yes, definitely.

578
00:31:40,608 --> 00:31:41,692
Let's go.

579
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:46,405
Hello.

580
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:50,242
I left my wallet in the office, guys.

581
00:31:50,826 --> 00:31:51,660
Tiwari!

582
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:56,749
Come, please.

583
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,086
CEO.

584
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:06,800
-Do you know him?
-Yes. He's our employee.

585
00:32:06,884 --> 00:32:08,594
He's been working here for a year.

586
00:32:08,802 --> 00:32:11,347
-Is there a problem, sir?
-Please swipe ahead.

587
00:32:12,097 --> 00:32:12,931
He's also an employee.

588
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,850
He was recruited six months ago.

589
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,101
Go on.

590
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,812
He's been here for two years now.

591
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:20,648
-What's the matter, sir?
-Nothing.

592
00:32:20,731 --> 00:32:22,316
We just want to talk to them.

593
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,902
Just co-operate with us and
everything will be fine.

594
00:32:24,985 --> 00:32:27,363
Nobody should know we're here.

595
00:32:27,988 --> 00:32:29,448
Alright, sir.

596
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:31,909
Let's go.
We're done here.

597
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:35,829
Pasha.

598
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:37,956
The CEO will meet you
at the back entrance.

599
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,249
Okay.

600
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:40,626
Let's go.

601
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:42,961
Good luck.

602
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,546
You call that undercover?

603
00:32:46,006 --> 00:32:49,176
Dress him in a saree and
he'll still look like a fucking commando.

604
00:32:50,386 --> 00:32:52,805
Guys, safeties off.

605
00:32:53,389 --> 00:32:54,473
That's Arshad.

606
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:56,850
He's in the sixth row
to the extreme right.

607
00:32:56,934 --> 00:33:00,104
Riyaz is in the tenth row
to the left.

608
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,981
And Hussain is in
the central section

609
00:33:03,065 --> 00:33:05,693
on the second-last row to the left.

610
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,144
Come on.

611
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,031
He's escaping!
Catch him!

612
00:33:54,158 --> 00:33:55,784
Stop!

613
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:00,289
Catch him!

614
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:05,127
Where's Hussain?

615
00:34:47,544 --> 00:34:51,048
How could you assume that
the kids are only my responsibility?

616
00:34:51,131 --> 00:34:52,674
Why are you taking me for granted?

617
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,927
Come on.
That's not what I meant!

618
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:56,470
Then what did you mean?

619
00:34:56,553 --> 00:34:59,056
I'll understand only if you 
 talk to me!

620
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,724
Why can't we have a proper conversation

621
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:02,100
like a normal couple for once!

622
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,394
Please, don't get your
psychology into this.

623
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,814
How is this psychology?

624
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,274
We were in the middle of
a discussion yesterday.

625
00:35:09,399 --> 00:35:11,485
Your phone rang and
you left mid-conversation.

626
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,362
You didn't talk to me 
 even when you came back.

627
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,030
Suchi, please try and understand.

628
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:17,616
You must be thinking, 
 "Suchi keeps whining all the time.

629
00:35:17,699 --> 00:35:19,368
If I ignore her, 
 everything will be back to normal--"

630
00:35:19,451 --> 00:35:21,411
Suchi, I have to go.
I'll talk to you later.

631
00:35:21,495 --> 00:35:23,789
-That's the bastard!
-Motherfucker!

632
00:35:23,872 --> 00:35:25,582
Let's go!

633
00:35:28,877 --> 00:35:30,546
Catch him!

634
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:34,591
Catch him!

635
00:35:37,928 --> 00:35:39,930
What are you looking at, fucker?
Just catch him!

636
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,898
Run!

637
00:35:50,315 --> 00:35:51,358
Catch him!

638
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:53,569
Don't let him go!

639
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:56,113
-Come with me.
-I will wait for you.

640
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:58,574
Fucker! You want me to catch him
all by myself?

641
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,794
Step aside!

642
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:13,255
Move!

643
00:36:14,381 --> 00:36:16,300
Stop, stop!

644
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:19,261
Stop! Stop, asshole!

645
00:36:19,595 --> 00:36:21,763
Stop! Please, stop!

646
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:23,807
-Please stop.
-Who the hell are you?

647
00:36:23,891 --> 00:36:25,225
He stole my wife's Mangalsutra!

648
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:27,060
Mangalsutra! Hop on!

649
00:36:27,144 --> 00:36:29,021
My wife will divorce me!

650
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:36,320
Run, fucker!

651
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:37,946
Let me see how far you can run.

652
00:36:38,447 --> 00:36:41,658
If you stop,
I'll kick your ass so hard

653
00:36:41,950 --> 00:36:43,827
you'll scream every time you take a shit.

654
00:36:43,911 --> 00:36:45,579
-Yuck!
-Sorry, ma'am!

655
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:47,289
This is the only way to talk to them.

656
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,124
Otherwise, they don't give a damn!

657
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,918
Run!

658
00:36:51,501 --> 00:36:53,670
What happened? Tired already?

659
00:36:53,921 --> 00:36:55,172
Are you tired?

660
00:36:55,297 --> 00:36:57,049
Stop, ma'am.

661
00:37:01,303 --> 00:37:03,805
-How dare you steal the Mangalsutra! 
-Oh, yes.

662
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,224
-Give me the Mangalsutra back.
 -Mangalsutra?

663
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,643
You may leave, ma'am.
Thank you.

664
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,895
-Don't spare him.
-Thank you, ma'am.

665
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:16,610
-Sorry...
-You think you're Usain Bolt?

666
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,003
Does it hurt here?

667
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:44,054
Fatima, I'm going to give you some pills.

668
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:48,600
It's okay, you can pay me the next time.

669
00:37:49,142 --> 00:37:52,062
Come on. You don't have to.

670
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,738
-I'll be right back.
-Alright.

671
00:38:27,514 --> 00:38:29,266
Give me a couple of apples.

672
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:34,688
Keep it.

673
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:41,611
Sir, you forgot your wallet.

674
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:45,490
No problem.
I'll give it back to him.

675
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,872
Sir!

676
00:38:52,205 --> 00:38:53,749
Your wallet.

677
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,918
Thank you.

678
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,999
Tell me, who's your boss?

679
00:39:36,166 --> 00:39:37,959
I don't know who you're talking about.

680
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:40,212
The one who planted the bomb
at Kala Ghoda.

681
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:41,505
I don't understand, sir.

682
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:44,007
What do you know about
the scooter blast

683
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,634
that took place in Kala Ghoda?

684
00:39:47,552 --> 00:39:49,596
Don't be so coy, darling.

685
00:39:49,805 --> 00:39:52,057
You can't hide the truth for long.

686
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:53,725
Tell me, or else...

687
00:39:54,309 --> 00:39:56,478
I'll shove my hand down
your throat and get the truth out.

688
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:59,147
Aren't you fed up of running?

689
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:05,862
Every time...

690
00:40:07,322 --> 00:40:09,032
Oh, fuck!
Pasha.

691
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:13,912
Whether this is good news or bad news,

692
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:16,289
I'm not quite certain, Srikant.

693
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:21,878
But a sleeper agent of RAW
from Balochistan has tipped us.

694
00:40:22,754 --> 00:40:24,714
Something big is being planned.

695
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:27,801
Those three men who 
 were caught in Kochi

696
00:40:27,884 --> 00:40:30,554
and the scooter bomber 
 are involved in this.

697
00:40:30,971 --> 00:40:32,639
We need to find out what
they're up to

698
00:40:32,722 --> 00:40:34,307
and when they plan to pull it off.

699
00:40:34,391 --> 00:40:36,268
This mission is called...

700
00:40:36,393 --> 00:40:37,686
Zulfiqar.

701
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,479
Okay, sir.

702
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,022
Thank you, sir.

703
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,659
Pasha, give me your pistol.

704
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:55,287
Why?

705
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:57,622
What do you mean why?
Give it to me.

706
00:41:04,087 --> 00:41:06,464
Trust me, I won't do anything.

707
00:41:20,312 --> 00:41:23,607
Hussain, I'm a bit exhausted now.

708
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:24,774
Okay?

709
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:27,736
I am done talking.
Just tell me.

710
00:41:28,862 --> 00:41:29,696
What?

711
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,243
-This is illegal.
-I don't give a fuck!

712
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:37,412
Motherfucker!

713
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,289
-Srikant!
-Hussain!

714
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,415
Riyaz!

715
00:41:41,166 --> 00:41:42,375
Are you serious?

716
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:43,835
Srikant!

717
00:41:43,919 --> 00:41:45,128
Hussain!

718
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:47,797
Get me out of here!

719
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:50,217
I'll tell you!
I'll tell you everything!

720
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,885
I'll tell you everything!

721
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:56,348
I've never talked to him.

722
00:41:57,474 --> 00:41:59,601
He always calls up Arshad...

723
00:41:59,935 --> 00:42:02,604
-and speaks only to him.
-I only get messages.

724
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:05,023
He tells me what to pick up and
where to drop it off.

725
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:08,068
He shares manuals,
like how to make bombs,

726
00:42:08,151 --> 00:42:09,778
how to escape from the cops.

727
00:42:09,861 --> 00:42:13,198
How to avoid being traced on the
internet and mobile phones.

728
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:14,908
All that sort of stuff, sir.

729
00:42:14,991 --> 00:42:16,576
-Did you ever practice those?
-No, sir.

730
00:42:17,327 --> 00:42:18,954
He never meets us personally.

731
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:21,164
He always leaves something in a drop box.

732
00:42:21,248 --> 00:42:23,792
We get a message whenever we
need to retrieve something from it.

733
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:25,835
We were talking about him yesterday.

734
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:27,254
Maybe he's a Pathan.

735
00:42:27,337 --> 00:42:28,463
Maybe...

736
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,591
-we don't know.
-And?

737
00:42:31,675 --> 00:42:35,470
I think he must be in his twenties.

738
00:42:35,804 --> 00:42:36,930
Or...

739
00:42:37,013 --> 00:42:39,849
Yes, definitely younger than 25.

740
00:42:39,975 --> 00:42:41,142
Where's the drop box?

741
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,311
In front of the Victoria College Hostel.

742
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,981
Sir, I think he studies
at Victoria College.

743
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:47,857
He stays in the hostel.

744
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,486
I'm telling you the truth.

745
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,130
We'll have to
monitor the drop box.

746
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:26,980
Get it done.

747
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:30,859
By the way...

748
00:43:31,443 --> 00:43:32,402
good job.

749
00:43:32,527 --> 00:43:35,155
Bullets were fired.
Of course you liked it.

750
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,704
Next time you fire,
at least warn me.

751
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:44,706
Oh, wow!

752
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,208
Rambo is a smoker!

753
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,211
Please tell me you drink as well.

754
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,005
We can drown our past quarrels!

755
00:44:04,017 --> 00:44:05,852
Kareem, please don't create a scene.

756
00:44:05,935 --> 00:44:06,811
Get up.

757
00:44:07,312 --> 00:44:09,439
-Sit.
-Kareem, just get up.

758
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:10,648
Just sit down.

759
00:44:12,108 --> 00:44:13,526
Hey, get up!

760
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,111
He's not standing up!

761
00:44:17,197 --> 00:44:18,073
Get up!

762
00:44:18,156 --> 00:44:20,241
Can't you see
the national anthem is playing?

763
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:21,993
There's no rule that
says I must stand up.

764
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:24,079
There's no rule to respect
your parents either.

765
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:25,538
Come on, stand up.

766
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,666
Our soldiers die for us at the border
and you can't even stand up?

767
00:44:29,209 --> 00:44:31,211
The same soldiers who kill
innocent children in Kashmir?

768
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:33,088
-What did you say?
-Stand up!

769
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:35,423
-It's your national anthem, not mine.
-Our national anthem?

770
00:44:35,507 --> 00:44:37,467
-Are you from Pakistan?
-Hey, don't touch me!

771
00:44:45,016 --> 00:44:46,101
Thanks.

772
00:44:50,897 --> 00:44:52,482
Do you want me to come up?

773
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:53,733
Not now.

774
00:44:54,025 --> 00:44:55,360
I have some work to do.

775
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:56,778
Bye.
