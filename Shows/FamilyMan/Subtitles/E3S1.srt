1
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,979
-What are you doing tonight?
-Nothing new.

2
00:00:20,062 --> 00:00:22,148
I'll go home and listen
to my wife complain

3
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:26,235
that the boss pays a measly salary
and I work extra hours.

4
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,571
Step on the gas.

5
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:30,156
Let's get there before seven

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:31,741
and watch the new Salman Khan film.

7
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:34,660
If you buy me the ticket,
I'll get you there before seven.

8
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:36,078
Done, buddy.

9
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:38,998
What's going on?

10
00:00:39,498 --> 00:00:41,208
Looks like there was an accident.

11
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:43,878
Get rid of this!

12
00:00:44,003 --> 00:00:45,379
Let's get the hell out of here!

13
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,426
You there! Stop!

14
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,056
-Stop! Damn you!
-Get out!

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,100
Where are you coming from?

16
00:00:58,184 --> 00:00:59,351
From the market.

17
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:00,978
I see.
What's your name?

18
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:04,190
Cat got your tongue, fucker?

19
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,067
Let's see some ID, shall we?

20
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,195
Feroz Ahmed.

21
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:11,113
-What are you carrying in the truck?
-Nothing.

22
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,448
-Is it beef?
-No, it's not beef.

23
00:01:12,531 --> 00:01:14,283
Check the back of the truck.

24
00:01:15,785 --> 00:01:18,245
-What is it? Tell me.
-It's mutton.

25
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:19,789
Mutton?

26
00:01:20,456 --> 00:01:21,791
-Bhaskar!
-Yes?

27
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:23,626
These motherfuckers
are carrying beef!

28
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,337
Motherfucker!

29
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,380
Brother, it's not beef.
I swear to God!

30
00:01:28,464 --> 00:01:30,841
Fucker, come out!
How dare you!

31
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,719
Come here, motherfucker!
I'll show you!

32
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,304
Did you really think

33
00:01:35,387 --> 00:01:38,891
that if you'll kill our holy cow
we won't do anything about it?

34
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,227
We'll slaughter all of you!

35
00:01:46,357 --> 00:01:48,108
You dare slaughter
the holy cow, our mother?

36
00:01:48,192 --> 00:01:49,652
You will be slaughtered too!

37
00:01:50,236 --> 00:01:52,196
Beat the fuck out of them!

38
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,697
Hold him straight!

39
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,202
Motherfucker!

40
00:02:17,221 --> 00:02:21,058
Two men, Amjad Ali, 
 and Feroz Ahmed

41
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:24,687
were beaten to death 
 by a mob outside Pune

42
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,272
under suspicion of carrying beef.

43
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:30,693
One died on the spot and the other, 
 on the way to the hospital.

44
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:33,362
Investigations reveal the meat 
 was not even beef--

45
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,030
Why do you watch such news?

46
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,283
Is it going to stop them
from doing such things?

47
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:39,285
That's not what I meant.

48
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:41,036
Then what do you mean, Jonali?

49
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,038
You want me to stop
thinking about this?

50
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:46,166
Kareem, you can retaliate.
But not through anger.

51
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,544
Retaliate through your work,
the way you always do.

52
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,297
Mere words won't help.

53
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:56,427
Kareem, such thoughts don't make
you any different from them.

54
00:02:58,804 --> 00:03:01,056
This is the only language
they understand.

55
00:03:02,308 --> 00:03:05,060
Because people have
become numb from within.

56
00:03:05,936 --> 00:03:08,898
They watch such news every day
and then they say...

57
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,358
"What's going on in this country?"

58
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,152
And that's it!

59
00:03:13,986 --> 00:03:16,030
People have a five-minute
attention span these days.

60
00:03:16,697 --> 00:03:17,781
After five minutes

61
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,825
they watch a funny video,
and forget everything.

62
00:03:19,909 --> 00:03:21,035
Kareem, please!

63
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,079
Stop being this negative!

64
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:27,416
Sometimes, you seem
scarier than them.

65
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,586
That's good.
Today, you're scared

66
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,005
-tomorrow, they'll be.
-Oh, shut up, Kareem!

67
00:03:33,088 --> 00:03:35,049
Not everyone's wielding a sword.

68
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,426
But the ones with the swords
are calling the shots.

69
00:03:54,068 --> 00:03:54,944
Hello.

70
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:58,906
Are you new here?

71
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,116
-Yes.
-Got cigarettes?

72
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,243
No.

73
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,495
Give me a cup of tea.

74
00:04:05,037 --> 00:04:07,665
I'll need to make it.
It'll take time.

75
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:14,838
No!

76
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:16,423
Don't touch the teddy bear.

77
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:18,217
-Will you make the tea or not?
-You really want it?

78
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,177
I thought you won't wait for just a cup.

79
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:23,097
-It will take time.
-Do you not want customers?

80
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:24,974
You come here to sleep?

81
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:35,943
-Hello, this is Shinde.
 -What's the update?

82
00:04:36,235 --> 00:04:38,654
I've been watching the box
since I arrived.

83
00:04:38,737 --> 00:04:40,656
I'll let you know if something happens.

84
00:04:56,171 --> 00:04:58,173
Bulletproof glass!

85
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:00,634
You know why it's here?

86
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:03,345
So that your fellow terrorists
can't attack you.

87
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,222
Then, there's us fools...

88
00:05:06,056 --> 00:05:08,350
trying to save your life.

89
00:05:08,934 --> 00:05:11,478
Tell me the truth.
What's Zulfiqar?

90
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:15,024
Zulfiqar?

91
00:05:17,026 --> 00:05:18,485
Mission Zulfiqar.

92
00:05:19,153 --> 00:05:21,780
I don't know anything
about this mission.

93
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,492
-I just want to see my mother--
-If you loved your mother so much

94
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,411
why the hell did you go to Syria?

95
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,795
Do you remember the 2002 riots?

96
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,384
At that time...

97
00:05:43,969 --> 00:05:45,971
my uncle used to live in Baroda.

98
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:50,684
Mom, Dad and my sister were visiting him.

99
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:53,395
They didn't step out of the house
for two days.

100
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,816
They were hoping...

101
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:01,570
that the riots would end soon.

102
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,782
But they didn't.

103
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,161
Two days later...

104
00:06:09,745 --> 00:06:11,413
a mob entered the house.

105
00:06:15,459 --> 00:06:18,128
My mother and sister hid under the bed.

106
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:23,842
They witnessed it all.

107
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,599
They watched the mob slaughter
my father and my uncle.

108
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:38,732
My sister screamed involuntarily.

109
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:44,571
Those bastards dragged them out...

110
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,327
and thrashed them like animals!

111
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,339
My mom wasn't lucky enough.
She survived.

112
00:07:05,134 --> 00:07:06,593
Since then...

113
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,096
she wakes up screaming
every single night.

114
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:13,767
My father, sister, and my uncle...

115
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,604
appear in her dreams every night.

116
00:07:22,359 --> 00:07:23,986
You have a family as well.

117
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:25,904
If something like this
would've happened to them...

118
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:28,240
what would you do?

119
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:34,371
I can't even imagine what
your family went through.

120
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:39,793
But an eye for an eye...

121
00:07:42,546 --> 00:07:44,548
will leave the whole world blind.

122
00:07:48,218 --> 00:07:50,345
You want to meet your mother, right?

123
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:53,015
Then tell me something useful.

124
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,643
You're not going to stay here
as a patient forever.

125
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:59,813
Think, Moosa!

126
00:08:08,655 --> 00:08:09,740
Excuse me.

127
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,700
Smoking is not allowed in the hospital.

128
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:18,498
-Where is it allowed, then?
-Outside the hospital.

129
00:08:24,463 --> 00:08:26,798
Moosa, I'll be back.

130
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:38,268
The students of Victoria College
have always been this way.

131
00:08:38,518 --> 00:08:40,270
They just call themselves "students."

132
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,481
But in fact, they're always
bitching about the country.

133
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,193
And I'm sure you're right.

134
00:08:46,693 --> 00:08:48,362
I suspect them too.

135
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:51,198
One of those bastards
is responsible for the blast.

136
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:52,950
Do you suspect anybody in particular?

137
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,993
Someone with a criminal record
or something.

138
00:08:55,077 --> 00:08:58,121
I have the list ready.
They're all anti-nationals.

139
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,083
Alright. Okay...

140
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,585
Tell me the names of the ones
with prior arrest warrants.

141
00:09:04,169 --> 00:09:05,420
There are four.

142
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,339
The first one is Junaid.

143
00:09:07,631 --> 00:09:09,466
He's been studying here for two years.

144
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,635
Then, there's Sait,
who's been here for three years.

145
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,428
Sajid. He took up
a three-year course

146
00:09:13,512 --> 00:09:15,847
but has been at it
for six years now!

147
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,557
Amir Peeran, he's from Pune.

148
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:19,851
But he used to study 
 in Saudi Arabia before.

149
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:35,617
All of them are in custody, sir.

150
00:09:35,701 --> 00:09:36,743
Hold on!

151
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,704
I asked you to make a list.

152
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:41,123
How could you arrest them
without a warrant?

153
00:09:41,206 --> 00:09:43,583
Don't worry about the warrant, sir.

154
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,545
Leave it to me.
It's a routine.

155
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,338
And these bastards are elusive.

156
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,173
Let's use our time with them wisely.

157
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,218
-They are locked up in a cell here. 
-Okay, I'm on my way.

158
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:56,847
Why have you arrested us?

159
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,181
Do you have a warrant?

160
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:01,310
Bloody motherfucker!
This is my warrant!

161
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,145
Want me to shove it up?

162
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,272
Fucker!

163
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:09,192
You've arrested us
because we are Muslims.

164
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,778
Damn it! Has he lost it?

165
00:10:11,862 --> 00:10:12,946
Sir...

166
00:10:13,447 --> 00:10:15,866
Sir, I don't even know them.

167
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:18,243
-Why am I here with--
-Shut up!

168
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,872
-You're a fucking coward.
-Don't call me a coward.

169
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:24,875
-I am nothing like you.
-Shut the hell up!

170
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:27,836
You think you're here to gossip?

171
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,422
Just answer my questions, that's it!

172
00:10:30,547 --> 00:10:33,216
Sir, we don't know anything
about the bomb blast.

173
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,052
Why are you questioning us?

174
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,137
You piece of shit!

175
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,443
Hello, sir.

176
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,947
Do you have any evidence
on the ones you have arrested?

177
00:10:56,031 --> 00:10:57,449
What will we do with evidence, sir?

178
00:10:57,532 --> 00:10:58,867
-We already know everything.
-Really?

179
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,702
They're all anti-nationals.

180
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:02,788
Sir, they were partying
on the day of the blast.

181
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:06,875
And if Pakistan wins
a match against India

182
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,585
they'll party all night!

183
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:10,504
And that makes them anti-national?

184
00:11:11,254 --> 00:11:13,298
Have you lost it, Jadhav?

185
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,634
Sir, you'd asked me to
conduct an investigation

186
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,136
and to round up
suspects in the college, right?

187
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,846
Sir, just give me two days.

188
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:22,099
I'll shove a baton up their asses
and get the truth out.

189
00:11:22,307 --> 00:11:24,226
You'll get a written confession.

190
00:11:26,353 --> 00:11:28,438
Do you want a written confession

191
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,357
with a baton shoved
up their asses?

192
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:35,278
What a waste of time!

193
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:36,863
Any movement at the drop box?

194
00:11:36,988 --> 00:11:38,824
Crows are shitting on it.
Nothing else.

195
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,576
The local police have the place
under 24/7 surveillance.

196
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:43,703
I hope they don't doze off.

197
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:45,372
I hope so, too.

198
00:11:56,925 --> 00:11:58,802
For fuck's sake!

199
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,053
Get lost!

200
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,849
Don't touch the teddy bear, asshole!

201
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,934
Get lost!

202
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,666
-Yeah, Arvind?
-Hi, Suchi.

203
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,002
-Where are you?
 -What happened?

204
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:35,338
-Are you going home?
-Yeah, why?

205
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,591
I'm at Potluck.

206
00:12:37,716 --> 00:12:39,384
Can you come over for fifteen minutes?

207
00:12:39,468 --> 00:12:41,887
I want to discuss something important.
It's a bit urgent.

208
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:44,556
Yes, I can.
But what happened?

209
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,892
Just come over. 
 It won't take long.

210
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,644
Call me when you reach Potluck.

211
00:12:49,895 --> 00:12:50,896
Okay.

212
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,150
Please stop here.

213
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:06,161
Welcome, ma'am.
Do you have a reservation?

214
00:13:06,244 --> 00:13:08,246
-Yeah--
-Hey, Suchi!

215
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:10,832
Thanks for coming.

216
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:13,793
I want to introduce you to
the CEO of my company, Nikhil.

217
00:13:13,877 --> 00:13:15,003
What?

218
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,631
-I mean... How?
-It's okay.

219
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,674
It's just a casual meeting,
nothing formal.

220
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,468
Once you meet him,
it'll be easier for you.

221
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:22,677
What will be easier?

222
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,305
To decide whether you want to join us.

223
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,390
What are you talking about?

224
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,644
Arvind, first of all,
I don't know what you do.

225
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:33,605
I have no idea what
I will do in this company.

226
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,524
And what will I say?

227
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,609
You're great with people,
so just relax.

228
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:39,778
And it's a start-up.
We're not a corporate structure.

229
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,489
Knowing you, you'll easily learn
on the job, in no time.

230
00:13:42,572 --> 00:13:44,115
I think you'll be great.

231
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,116
Trust me!

232
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,536
I wish I had as much confidence
in myself as you do!

233
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,955
You know what the secret
to confidence is?

234
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,665
Pretend to be confident.

235
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,292
-Nikhil, this is Suchitra.
-Hi!

236
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,835
So, you are Suchi.

237
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,837
-Nice meeting you, finally.
-Nice meeting you too.

238
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,464
It's okay if I call you Suchi, right?

239
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,341
-Yeah, of course.
-Please sit.

240
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,636
Arvind's always talking about you.

241
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,639
I'm glad Arvind convinced you.

242
00:14:07,806 --> 00:14:09,307
I promise, you won't regret it.

243
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,185
So what made you change
your mind?

244
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:14,729
I mean, do you have an idea
what exactly we do

245
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:17,065
what our goals are,
what our plans are?

246
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:21,778
Well...

247
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:23,613
sort of.

248
00:14:23,697 --> 00:14:26,324
But, Arvind has,
you know, given me a--

249
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:28,159
Sorry, I don't mean to rush things.

250
00:14:28,285 --> 00:14:29,911
Relax, it's not an interview.

251
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:32,956
We can chat about this later.
Let's order something.

252
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,124
Excuse me.

253
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,796
Thank you. Please order.

254
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:56,396
You know, I've noticed that
people consider psychology

255
00:14:56,479 --> 00:14:59,608
just as an easy subject
in the college syllabus.

256
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:02,819
They don't know how it could
have any use in real life.

257
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,487
But when Arvind told me
about the initiative

258
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:07,115
you guys were starting,
I finally felt

259
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,326
that there's a chance to
do something in real life.

260
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,036
I thought it was a brilliant idea.

261
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,830
The best part is that,
it's not just an app.

262
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,750
You're actually synergizing
it with a 360 vertical.

263
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,418
And I love the fact that

264
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,503
we're going from theory to practice.

265
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:21,796
So...

266
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:26,635
Wow! Even I cannot explain it so well.

267
00:15:27,344 --> 00:15:29,596
No wonder Arvind thinks so highly of you.

268
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:31,306
Is it okay if I borrow some
of these lines?

269
00:15:31,389 --> 00:15:32,557
Sure.

270
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:35,393
-You ambushed me!
-"Ambushed"?

271
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:36,978
I did nothing of that sort.

272
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:39,898
I wish I had some more time
to prepare better.

273
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:42,108
Why do you need to prepare?
You were just great!

274
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:43,026
Yeah, right!

275
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:44,152
Arvind...

276
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:46,988
how will I manage it all
in such short time?

277
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:49,991
You know, it's not just about
changing jobs.

278
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:53,328
There are other factors,
like travelling and timings.

279
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:56,456
Besides, there are no benefits in the job.

280
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:58,416
Forget that.

281
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,835
The main reason I took up
a teaching job was my kids.

282
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,796
So that I could give them quality time.

283
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:05,090
It's not as complicated
as you think.

284
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,675
It will work out.

285
00:16:08,802 --> 00:16:10,553
I don't know what Sri will say.

286
00:16:13,848 --> 00:16:15,725
I'm taking the same route,
do you need a lift?

287
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:17,519
-No, don't worry about it.
-Are you sure?

288
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:19,813
-Yeah, don't worry. I'll see you.
-See you.

289
00:16:34,619 --> 00:16:36,246
As-salaam alaikum, Altaf Bhai.

290
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,957
Wa alaykumu as-salam.

291
00:16:39,457 --> 00:16:41,418
It's an honor to meet you
after such a long time!

292
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,420
The honor's all mine, Kareem.

293
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:47,882
I love reading your blog,
your work, your exploits...

294
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:49,801
You are a hero, a real hero.

295
00:16:49,884 --> 00:16:51,261
I trust you a lot.

296
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:53,763
-You know that, right?
-I know.

297
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,766
And I also know why you've called me here.

298
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,435
Altaf Bhai, I've told you already.

299
00:16:58,518 --> 00:17:01,771
I won't join your group.
I prefer working alone.

300
00:17:02,188 --> 00:17:05,483
Don't worry, it's something
you'll understand.

301
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:09,112
I have something
you need to see.

302
00:17:09,863 --> 00:17:12,282
These bastards need a taste
of their own medicine.

303
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:28,173
-It's not for you.
-What is it?

304
00:17:28,256 --> 00:17:29,507
I said it's not for you.

305
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:32,552
I know what it is.
I've watched the ad on TV.

306
00:17:32,677 --> 00:17:34,971
There's a girl in the ad,
who looks very stressed.

307
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,017
But once she uses this,
she becomes energetic.

308
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,895
Then, she runs and
jumps around everywhere.

309
00:17:41,978 --> 00:17:43,855
Shut up and move along.

310
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,483
Why don't you just tell him?

311
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:49,611
-What's the problem?
-What do I tell him?

312
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:52,614
It's not a bomb.
It's a sanitary pad, okay?

313
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:54,991
There's nothing to hide about it.

314
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:58,077
Girls have periods,
and boys are dumbasses.

315
00:17:58,203 --> 00:17:59,621
Hello, hello!

316
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,915
What kind of language is this!

317
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:03,541
Where are you learning this?

318
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,752
At the school you send me to.

319
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,342
-Tell me something.
-Yes?

320
00:18:12,425 --> 00:18:13,802
Does your sister have a boyfriend?

321
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,345
Yes, she might have one.

322
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,055
"Might"?
Does she have one or not?

323
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,224
Yes, she does.
And she should.

324
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,767
What do you mean "she should"?

325
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,310
Just tell me if she has one or not.

326
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,603
Yes. I think so.

327
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:24,687
You think so?

328
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,064
Just tell me,
does she have one or not?

329
00:18:26,147 --> 00:18:28,399
She does.
How many times do I tell you?

330
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:35,490
Hello. Whom are you talking to?

331
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:38,493
Dad, there's something
called privacy, okay?

332
00:19:15,488 --> 00:19:18,116
If you were hungry,
you should have said so.

333
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:19,826
Why did you steal?

334
00:19:20,952 --> 00:19:25,039
Once you finish your job,
it's all yours.

335
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,709
Damn it, the memory card is full!

336
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,588
Do your work diligently.

337
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,090
Otherwise, you'll be screwed.

338
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:37,552
This card's not working!

339
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,762
Bloody Chinese goods!

340
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,890
It was working fine yesterday.

341
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,684
What the fuck happened today!

342
00:19:48,563 --> 00:19:50,231
It's working now.

343
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:55,069
Oh! That's the guy you were waiting for!

344
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,029
Fuck!

345
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,547
What do you want to eat today?

346
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,174
-Pasta!
-McDonald's!

347
00:20:16,299 --> 00:20:17,800
Something that can be cooked at home.

348
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,427
Can you cook chicken?

349
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,803
Chicken?

350
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:23,389
If you even think about cooking chicken

351
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,100
your mother's forefathers
will turn in their graves.

352
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:28,645
Fine, make veg biryani.

353
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:31,064
Veg biryani is an oxymoron, okay!

354
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,482
What's an oxymoron?

355
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:35,944
Like veg burger,
like "good Atharv!"

356
00:20:36,027 --> 00:20:37,487
But I'm still good.

357
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,697
No, you're an oxymoron
and a moron.

358
00:20:39,781 --> 00:20:42,533
-And you're a much moron!
-Alright, veg biryani.

359
00:20:42,659 --> 00:20:43,743
Okay? Alright.

360
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:45,703
-No peas.
-And no onions.

361
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:48,623
Let's just boil some rice and eat it.

362
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,501
What's that?

363
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,045
Our supplies.

364
00:20:54,379 --> 00:20:55,463
You're selling those chocolates?

365
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,508
You kids get a little freedom
and you raid the whole damn place!

366
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:02,011
You two--

367
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:06,015
Are you sure?

368
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:10,353
Whenever they start forgetting it

369
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:13,189
it's our duty to show them their place.

370
00:21:13,481 --> 00:21:16,317
Today, they're killing and eating 
 our holy mother, the cow!

371
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,528
Tomorrow, they'll barge into our houses,

372
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:21,656
chop us and eat us, and our women.

373
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:25,034
What they really want to do is 
 throw us out of our own country!

374
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,160
Bloody traitors!

375
00:21:26,244 --> 00:21:27,787
Bloody traitors!

376
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:29,330
Whatever happens

377
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:32,709
it is our sacred duty 
 to save our motherland!

378
00:21:34,836 --> 00:21:38,172
Slaughter each one of them!

379
00:21:38,339 --> 00:21:40,049
Don't worry about the police.

380
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,260
I'll take care of them!

381
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:44,929
Bhaskar...

382
00:21:51,561 --> 00:21:53,479
He was inciting them in broad daylight!

383
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,274
And then they went on
to kill those two Muslims.

384
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:58,443
This is clearly a pre-planned murder!

385
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:01,070
Kareem, we should
show this to the police.

386
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:03,698
What do you think will happen then?

387
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:06,075
You think the police will
arrest that minister?

388
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,453
They'll throw us behind bars instead.

389
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,914
And then eat biryani in his fucking house.

390
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,712
Jonali! Jonali, wait!

391
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:20,757
Where did you get this video from?

392
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,842
Does it matter?

393
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:26,596
Kareem, please!
Don't do anything stupid!

394
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:29,140
Jonali, just stay out of it.
Please!

395
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:39,108
There is no other way.

396
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:41,527
We've to give them
the taste of their own medicine.

397
00:22:42,445 --> 00:22:43,988
It's our turn to strike!

398
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,581
-Shinde.
-Yes, sir?

399
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:56,918
Where's the recording
that shows him using the drop box?

400
00:22:58,961 --> 00:23:00,296
-Were you asleep?
-No, sir!

401
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,924
The camera's memory card was full.

402
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:04,675
I was replacing it when--

403
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,845
Shinde, please wait outside.

404
00:23:08,262 --> 00:23:09,347
Yes, sir.

405
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:12,600
-Any intel on this boy?
-Kareem Bhat from Srinagar.

406
00:23:12,683 --> 00:23:14,393
He's been in Mumbai
for the last four years

407
00:23:14,477 --> 00:23:16,437
pursuing a post-graduation in Victoria.

408
00:23:16,521 --> 00:23:18,940
He's quite active on
social media as "Mighty Kalam."

409
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:21,150
He also writes blogs
on the situation in Kashmir.

410
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,778
A few years ago,
one of his videos went viral.

411
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,573
Even a dog doesn't give birth 
 to so many puppies.

412
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:33,663
We need to stop them 
 before they outnumber us.

413
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,623
We need to save this country!

414
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:37,333
We need to protect our religion!

415
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,502
Sir, why are you spreading hatred?

416
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,838
-Who said that? 
 -Hey, move aside.

417
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,714
The truth is always bitter, son.

418
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:45,383
To stay in this country--

419
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:50,179
Nothing after this ink attack.

420
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:51,973
He's kept a low profile ever since.

421
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:53,975
He's in touch via Facebook and email

422
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:56,853
with people who have links
to extremist groups.

423
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:58,980
-Criminal records?
-No, sir.

424
00:23:59,063 --> 00:24:00,565
-Has he ever been arrested?
-Never.

425
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:03,359
There's no evidence of his
connection with a terrorist group.

426
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,778
That means he works alone.
Lone wolf!

427
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:08,072
Why are you jumping to conclusions?

428
00:24:08,197 --> 00:24:09,615
First confirm it.

429
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:11,534
Don't involve the local police.

430
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,536
And keep that fucker Jadhav out of this!

431
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,205
He roams around with a
trident to hunt anti-nationals!

432
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:18,082
So, we do this in-house?

433
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:19,834
Contact the operations team.

434
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:21,294
Put Milind and Jayesh on the job.

435
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,921
You, Zoya, and I will co-ordinate this.

436
00:24:28,885 --> 00:24:31,262
-Oh, Shinde.
-Sir!

437
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,183
-Are you from the local police?
-Yes, sir.

438
00:24:35,308 --> 00:24:37,935
That's why your brain runs faster
than a train.

439
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:39,061
Thank you, sir.

440
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,314
But you see, Shinde...

441
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,901
along with those brains,
you also need to keep your eyes open!

442
00:24:46,736 --> 00:24:48,779
They just have one job, anyway, right?

443
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:50,364
To see.

444
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,033
Yes, sir.

445
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:55,411
-Good job.
-Thank you, sir.

446
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:02,043
Oh, Shinde.

447
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:04,253
Bye.

448
00:25:12,553 --> 00:25:14,805
-Are you sure?
-What do you mean?

449
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,058
Sir, we've done our homework.

450
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,352
This college is a nightmare!

451
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:22,271
First the papers leaked,
then a drug racket

452
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:24,065
and now this!

453
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:27,735
Sir, the lightning doesn't ask
before striking.

454
00:25:28,486 --> 00:25:30,238
This is our warden, Mr. Gupta.

455
00:25:30,321 --> 00:25:32,531
And this is Mr. Pimple from the NCDC.

456
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:33,616
Listen.

457
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:36,827
We'll need to evacuate the
extension wing of the senior hostel.

458
00:25:37,078 --> 00:25:40,414
But none of the students
have complained yet.

459
00:25:40,498 --> 00:25:42,792
Will you take action
only when someone dies?

460
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,377
-No.
-Sir.

461
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,337
What kind of logic is this?

462
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:48,464
Mr. Gupta, what kind of logic is this?

463
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,217
Will you take action
only when someone dies?

464
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,303
-How much time do you need?
-Ten minutes, sir.

465
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:56,931
So this is worse than dengue?

466
00:25:57,223 --> 00:25:58,683
Ten times more so, sir.

467
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:02,144
That's why we have special chemicals.

468
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:03,854
Shall we begin?

469
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,571
Sir, why don't you let us do this?

470
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:14,865
-We'll let you know when we're done.
-Let me see.

471
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:17,952
Sir, this gas is poisonous
and the virus, dangerous.

472
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:20,538
We'll finish and let you know.

473
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:28,170
I have an eye on Kareem.

474
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:31,257
-We need to make it quick.
-I know. In and out.

475
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:36,595
I'm sweating out of new
orifices in this suit!

476
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:37,972
It's alright.

477
00:26:38,055 --> 00:26:40,349
-All the best.
-Yeah, all the best.

478
00:26:56,866 --> 00:26:57,992
What's the status?

479
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:00,870
He's nearby. Just a ten-minute
walk from the hostel.

480
00:27:06,375 --> 00:27:07,376
Finally!

481
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,878
A little bit to the right.

482
00:27:09,378 --> 00:27:11,547
-Perfect! Lock it.
-Here you go, okay!

483
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:19,221
Is the mic okay?

484
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:20,514
-Can you hear me? 
-Yes!

485
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,682
-Great.
-Okay.

486
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:23,059
Putting cam two.

487
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,895
What are you guys doing here?

488
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:28,022
We're releasing a disinfectant gas here!

489
00:27:28,105 --> 00:27:29,815
Come on, clear out!

490
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,529
Kareem is heading back.

491
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,615
Hurry up!
Kareem is on his way back.

492
00:27:37,698 --> 00:27:39,533
I'm on it. Chill!

493
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:42,453
Be on the lookout.

494
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,206
Hello!

495
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,916
Hello!

496
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:49,168
-Oh shit! Hurry up!
-I'm on it!

497
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,253
-Hello!
-Sir, what are you doing?

498
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,963
-I'll call NCDC.
-Don't come here.

499
00:27:53,047 --> 00:27:55,007
-The gas is poisonous.
-Nobody's coming in.

500
00:27:55,091 --> 00:27:57,218
He's getting into the hostel. 
 Guys, be quick!

501
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,929
-Fuck!
-Stop. Call your supervisor first!

502
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:02,431
Call your supervisor.

503
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,142
Sir, we'll be done in five minutes.

504
00:28:05,226 --> 00:28:08,396
No, this is not good.
I'll call NCDC.

505
00:28:08,938 --> 00:28:10,940
-Wait, I will call.
-Oh, hello!

506
00:28:11,315 --> 00:28:12,525
Where are you going?

507
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,403
The gas is poisonous!
Get out of here.

508
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:18,406
Who cares! We breathe this
toxic shit all day.

509
00:28:20,116 --> 00:28:22,326
-He's coming inside. 
-Okay!

510
00:28:22,952 --> 00:28:24,954
Milind, hurry up. 
 You have five seconds.

511
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:26,080
Hello!

512
00:28:37,258 --> 00:28:38,092
Fuck!

513
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:03,534
It's safe now.
You can use the toilet.

514
00:29:07,329 --> 00:29:08,372
Thank you.

515
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,466
Cam one online.

516
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:21,635
CCTV from the hostel is up.

517
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:25,139
Sir, I've accessed all of
Kareem's social media accounts.

518
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:27,766
His email, his blog, everything.
I am in!

519
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,145
Why don't you leave?

520
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:34,523
Leave, buddy.
The kids must be waiting.

521
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:37,318
All right, guys. See you.

522
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,570
-See you, sir!
-I will see you in the evening.

523
00:29:49,872 --> 00:29:50,998
Give me a cigarette.

524
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,543
There was a new stall here.

525
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:55,544
Where did it go?

526
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,255
He was here for two days.
I don't know where he's gone.

527
00:29:58,339 --> 00:29:59,423
How's that possible?

528
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,175
Strange fellow.

529
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,427
He had no interest in running
his business.

530
00:30:03,594 --> 00:30:06,013
Who knows what he was doing here!

531
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:23,572
Thank you.

532
00:30:30,037 --> 00:30:32,289
Mom, what are you doing here?
Go outside, please.

533
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,083
-Listen--
-I don't need any help.

534
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:36,126
I visited Swami Sarvanandji.

535
00:30:36,210 --> 00:30:39,004
-I've brought you--
-Mom, look at this!

536
00:30:39,088 --> 00:30:41,757
Thanks to you,
I look like a hermit.

537
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,092
Put this on.

538
00:30:44,343 --> 00:30:46,220
-Right.
-Okay.

539
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,596
And take this.

540
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:49,348
-What's this?
-The prasad.

541
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,724
Listen.

542
00:30:51,517 --> 00:30:53,686
Don't give it to anybody else.

543
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,480
You need more protection
than anyone else.

544
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,190
I always have a bomb
in my pocket, don't I?

545
00:30:58,274 --> 00:30:59,692
You're impossible.

546
00:30:59,817 --> 00:31:01,151
What's cooking?

547
00:31:01,235 --> 00:31:02,903
I'm not staging a
performance here!

548
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,488
Why are you guys here?
I don't need any help.

549
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,407
You just want to steal
my recipe, don't you?

550
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,576
-Go on, leave.
-May I say something?

551
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:10,744
You look very fit.

552
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,539
-You look like his younger brother!
-Did you hear that?

553
00:31:13,706 --> 00:31:15,791
He's running around a
lot lately, isn't he?

554
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,419
Chasing someone or the other.

555
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:19,670
What do you mean?

556
00:31:19,753 --> 00:31:21,422
You haven't visited us for so long.

557
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,923
Do you even remember the
last time visited us?

558
00:31:23,007 --> 00:31:24,216
There's too much work at the office.

559
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,843
I just don't have time.

560
00:31:29,263 --> 00:31:30,889
Yeah, he often says that his mother--

561
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:31,807
Shut up! Will you?

562
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,183
I mean, he always talks about her.

563
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:35,352
-He thinks about you all the time.
-Whatever!

564
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:36,729
Once we settle the home loan

565
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:38,814
we'll move somewhere else
so Mom can stay with us.

566
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,566
No chance.

567
00:31:40,816 --> 00:31:43,152
-Mom has settled in Powai.
-Shut up!

568
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,404
She's got a few good friends there.

569
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:02,588
-Dad.
-Yes, darling. Tell me.

570
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,468
Hello, Laxmi.
How are you?

571
00:32:07,551 --> 00:32:09,261
Hello!

572
00:32:09,553 --> 00:32:11,764
Thanks to the grace of Swami,
we're all well!

573
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,599
How are you and your wife?

574
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:16,310
Thanks to Lord Ayyappan's grace,
we're all good!

575
00:32:16,393 --> 00:32:18,812
Two melodious cultures
come together

576
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:20,898
to create a huge din!

577
00:32:21,148 --> 00:32:22,524
Dad, here.

578
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:26,570
Why is he talking so loudly?
Does he think we're deaf?

579
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:28,906
Is she deaf?
Why is she screaming so much?

580
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,699
Come on, Dad!

581
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:32,034
Where's Mom?

582
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:35,746
She had some urgent work
at the Matunga Tamil Association.

583
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,582
-What are they chattering about in Tamil?
-Mom!

584
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,085
I hope they aren't talking about us!

585
00:32:41,168 --> 00:32:42,169
Please don't start.

586
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:43,921
-Hello, Grandpa!
-Come here.

587
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,339
How are you, darling?

588
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:47,549
Where's your elder sister?

589
00:32:47,633 --> 00:32:49,343
Thank you, Grandpa.
Same to you!

590
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:51,470
What is this?

591
00:32:51,553 --> 00:32:52,888
Doesn't he understand Tamil?

592
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:56,517
Why don't you talk in Hindi?
Let us in on the conversation.

593
00:32:56,600 --> 00:32:58,769
Today, India is going to be split apart!

594
00:32:58,852 --> 00:33:00,312
All I am saying is...

595
00:33:00,604 --> 00:33:03,065
children should learn
their mother tongue.

596
00:33:03,148 --> 00:33:07,152
It's enough to know the
national language, Hindi.

597
00:33:07,444 --> 00:33:09,822
Hindi is not our
national language, ma'am.

598
00:33:09,905 --> 00:33:11,407
-Please!
-What?

599
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,409
Hindi is just one of the
official languages, ma'am.

600
00:33:13,492 --> 00:33:15,536
Don't you realize the
importance of Hindi?

601
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:18,372
Hindi has evolved from Sanskrit.

602
00:33:18,455 --> 00:33:21,250
And Sanskrit is the
world's oldest language.

603
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:23,836
But Tamil is much
older than Sanskrit.

604
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:25,254
Says who?

605
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,881
It is a fact.

606
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,945
Seriously? What are we watching?
Switch it off!

607
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:52,740
We've been told to keep
a constant watch on them.

608
00:33:53,198 --> 00:33:55,367
-We can't miss anything.
-Milind!

609
00:33:55,492 --> 00:33:56,535
Punit!

610
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:01,206
You never let me do my job.

611
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,715
Lower the volume.

612
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:15,012
Happy birthday to you!

613
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:18,766
Happy birthday to you!

614
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:23,103
Happy birthday, dear Atharv!

615
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:26,774
Happy birthday to you!

616
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:29,902
-Smear some cake on his face.
-No!

617
00:34:30,944 --> 00:34:32,279
It's the first piano I've ever eaten.

618
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:34,448
-Okay, Atharv!
-Dad!

619
00:34:36,575 --> 00:34:37,910
Feed the camera!

620
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,247
-It's good.
-Thank you.

621
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,332
You bought it from Madras?

622
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:45,083
No, from Matunga.

623
00:34:45,167 --> 00:34:47,503
Not everything is from Madras.

624
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,173
I hope it doesn't have egg in it.

625
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,552
Will I ever offer you
a cake with egg in it?

626
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,931
I called up the
bakery just for you

627
00:34:59,014 --> 00:35:00,516
and gave him
strict instructions

628
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,810
to give me an eggless cake!

629
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:05,270
Come on, eat up.

630
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:12,444
Did you ever think

631
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:14,530
you would have to do something like this?

632
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:16,490
Watch people make out?

633
00:35:18,075 --> 00:35:19,284
I know.

634
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:21,036
But we just need to do certain things.

635
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,622
A lot of it feels wrong.

636
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,166
But I keep reminding myself

637
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:27,876
I am doing this for the greater good.

638
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:29,503
Hopefully.

639
00:35:35,259 --> 00:35:37,135
Guys, come in, we have a guest.

640
00:35:37,219 --> 00:35:38,220
Let's go.

641
00:35:38,679 --> 00:35:40,430
-Did you get the van?
-Yes.

642
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,350
-When are we getting the stuff?
-Tomorrow.

643
00:35:43,851 --> 00:35:44,852
Who is it?

644
00:35:45,185 --> 00:35:46,186
I'm not sure.

645
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,522
-Did Nissar get the floor plan? 
 -Yes.

646
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,359
-Guest list? 
 -He's on it.

647
00:35:52,442 --> 00:35:54,111
He said he'll get it
directly to the base camp.

648
00:35:54,194 --> 00:35:55,696
He didn't want to email it.

649
00:35:55,779 --> 00:35:57,531
-I had asked him not to.
-You're right.

650
00:35:57,614 --> 00:35:59,324
You never know who's sniffing around.

651
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,492
Fuck!

652
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:02,703
They're planning something big.

653
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,872
Good.

654
00:36:06,498 --> 00:36:08,333
This biryani is good.

655
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:10,294
But, if you'd put some meat in it

656
00:36:10,377 --> 00:36:12,045
it would've been more delicious!

657
00:36:12,129 --> 00:36:13,338
Keep your voice down!

658
00:36:14,423 --> 00:36:16,884
If my father-in-law hears that,
you'll be slaughtered.

659
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:19,303
Please! Your mom is the same!

660
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,389
People are getting
slaughtered in the name of biryani.

661
00:36:22,472 --> 00:36:24,474
And we think the ISIS is brutal!

662
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:27,477
-Suchi!
-Yes?

663
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,688
Please tell him to take up an IT job.

664
00:36:29,771 --> 00:36:32,608
He's not going to listen to anyone.
Let him be!

665
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,817
Why don't you leave this job?

666
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:36,486
You've been serving the
country long enough.

667
00:36:36,862 --> 00:36:38,739
Now it's time to work for yourself.

668
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,033
JK, please convince him.

669
00:36:41,116 --> 00:36:43,201
Okay, but who'll convince me?

670
00:36:43,744 --> 00:36:45,037
Stop it, Suren.

671
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,872
Don't start the same old conversation!

672
00:36:46,955 --> 00:36:48,165
Listen, Suchi.

673
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:51,960
When Srikant was in school
he was everyone's darling.

674
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:56,214
Everyone thought he
would make it big!

675
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,967
That he'd be successful.
And what did he do?

676
00:36:59,134 --> 00:37:03,555
He became a patriot and
got a government job.

677
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:04,765
Stop it!

678
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:07,601
Everyone has their own priorities.

679
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:10,270
He wants to serve the nation.
It's his choice!

680
00:37:10,354 --> 00:37:12,898
Listen, all I am saying is

681
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,901
his job should pay him good, right?

682
00:37:16,443 --> 00:37:18,236
Just being patriotic
is not enough

683
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,905
to fill up your bank account.

684
00:37:20,864 --> 00:37:23,033
In fact, even I am serving the nation.

685
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,494
-I'm boosting the economy!
-Really?

686
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,371
Do you think you can
boost the economy

687
00:37:27,454 --> 00:37:28,872
if the country is not safe?

688
00:37:28,956 --> 00:37:31,124
-Let's shut down everything.
-Sri!

689
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,918
Try boosting the economy then!

690
00:37:33,627 --> 00:37:35,420
We're fucking morons, aren't we?

691
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,173
Change the topic!

692
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,634
Let's boost the party, not the economy.

693
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:43,011
-Good point!
-Sri, one couplet.

694
00:37:43,095 --> 00:37:45,472
-I'm not in the mood!
-Come on!

695
00:37:45,555 --> 00:37:47,557
-Please!
-One couplet, please!

696
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:51,061
What's that word? Irshad!

697
00:37:51,353 --> 00:37:52,729
Let me think.

698
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:55,941
Okay, here goes.

699
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:59,152
"There is no hope now...

700
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,241
There is no hope now

701
00:38:04,491 --> 00:38:07,285
I can't find that lovely face now

702
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:10,330
Once I used to laugh at my heart

703
00:38:10,622 --> 00:38:12,874
Nothing makes me laugh now"

704
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:16,628
What does it mean?

705
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:18,213
Now, one has to first say a couplet

706
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,091
and then explain it to this generation.

707
00:38:21,466 --> 00:38:23,677
Because there was no hashtag
in the couplet.

708
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:26,680
There's one for people like you too.
Listen!

709
00:38:26,888 --> 00:38:28,390
This is an original one.

710
00:38:28,515 --> 00:38:31,935
"There was a time when you could see
God in children..."

711
00:38:32,686 --> 00:38:36,398
When we were children,
one could see God within us.

712
00:38:37,065 --> 00:38:40,485
"There was a time when you could see
God in children..."

713
00:38:41,069 --> 00:38:44,156
But now you see children
Only on Instagram"

714
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:46,491
You should be on Instagram, okay?

715
00:38:46,575 --> 00:38:48,785
Wasting your 1000 grams of brain
on Instagram!

716
00:38:49,953 --> 00:38:52,330
-One more.
-Okay, let me think.

717
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,708
-Cover your ears.
-Why?

718
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:57,002
Can you ever listen to your father?

719
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,629
Come on, Dhriti.

720
00:38:59,796 --> 00:39:01,298
Cover your ears, please!

721
00:39:01,465 --> 00:39:04,009
"Her youth would incite
A jaljala inside me"

722
00:39:04,134 --> 00:39:05,927
"Jaljala" means volcano.

723
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:08,680
Correct!

724
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:12,142
"Her youth would incite
A jaljala inside me

725
00:39:12,642 --> 00:39:15,520
I know it would make my heart burst

726
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:17,481
But my phone always rang first"

727
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:21,902
-Ditto.
-Did you hear that?

728
00:39:28,658 --> 00:39:30,202
I need to go.

729
00:39:30,744 --> 00:39:33,371
-It's kind of urgent.
-Just two more couplets.

730
00:39:33,455 --> 00:39:35,123
-It's an emergency.
-Do you need to go?

731
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:36,958
Suchi, it is an emergency.

732
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:39,878
Sorry! You guys, continue.

733
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:10,075
Talpade...

734
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:16,164
I read Suchi's messages.

735
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:18,959
You've started checking Suchi's phone?

736
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,585
No, I wasn't checking.

737
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:24,339
I went into the room,
her phone was on the shelf.

738
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:27,425
And she got a text, so...

739
00:40:28,176 --> 00:40:30,679
What's that thing called...
"Review"?

740
00:40:30,804 --> 00:40:33,265
-Preview
-Yes, the preview, on the screen.

741
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:36,017
I read that.
I wasn't checking her phone.

742
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,269
Of course, you weren't.

743
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:38,520
You were just reading her messages.

744
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:41,022
Fucker!
Will you listen to what I'm saying?

745
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,567
Stop preaching!

746
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:51,700
-Her colleague--
-Tiwari, have you lost your mind?

747
00:40:52,742 --> 00:40:54,619
Don't jump to conclusions!

748
00:40:54,703 --> 00:40:58,039
Who texts a lady in the
middle of the night?

749
00:41:00,125 --> 00:41:02,294
-And, Suchi--
-What?

750
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:07,215
I've been noticing her.

751
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:12,179
She's always on the phone,
like a teenager.

752
00:41:12,596 --> 00:41:13,680
So what?

753
00:41:14,347 --> 00:41:16,099
If you won't talk to her

754
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:18,059
she'll need someone else to talk, right?

755
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,604
Fucker! I'll throw you out of the car!

756
00:41:20,729 --> 00:41:23,106
-What kind of a friend are you?
-Tell me something.

757
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,901
-Did you read her replies?
-No!

758
00:41:29,863 --> 00:41:33,491
But that jackass is
sending her dozens of emo...

759
00:41:33,575 --> 00:41:34,576
-Emojis.
-Right, emojis!

760
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:36,119
-Smileys.
-Yes, smileys.

761
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,538
What do you mean by "dozens"?

762
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:43,710
I mean...

763
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:47,881
Lots of emojis at once!

764
00:41:47,964 --> 00:41:50,217
Is there a fixed number
of smileys to be sent?

765
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,385
Will you land in trouble if you send more?

766
00:41:52,469 --> 00:41:54,221
All of this is very normal.

767
00:41:54,304 --> 00:41:55,555
We also do it, don't we?

768
00:41:56,765 --> 00:41:58,475
And Suchi is not a child.

769
00:41:59,309 --> 00:42:02,312
She can handle this kind of attention.

770
00:42:04,105 --> 00:42:05,774
She'll take care of it.

771
00:42:08,068 --> 00:42:09,903
The smiley that you mentioned...

772
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:12,072
Was it a normal one or like...

773
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:18,536
The one with a red heart on the lips.

774
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,829
Was it that one?

775
00:42:20,664 --> 00:42:22,415
No, not that one.

776
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,542
Then you're safe.

777
00:42:24,626 --> 00:42:26,127
-I'm safe?
-Yeah.

778
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:35,345
Milind, what's happening?

779
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:37,597
Sir, a guy named Iqbal came to meet him.

780
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:39,474
They were talking
about some delivery

781
00:42:39,557 --> 00:42:40,809
which will happen tomorrow.

782
00:42:40,892 --> 00:42:42,060
And, sir...

783
00:42:42,143 --> 00:42:44,604
they were also talking about
a guest list and a floor plan.

784
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,524
Some guy called Nissar
is coordinating this.

785
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,901
We haven't seen him until now
but he can come any time.

786
00:42:49,985 --> 00:42:52,570
Get me Iqbal's and Nissar's details.

787
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:54,072
Find out who they are.

788
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,532
Already done, sir.

789
00:43:01,121 --> 00:43:02,831
What? What happened?

790
00:43:02,914 --> 00:43:04,124
Must be a power cut, sir.

791
00:43:04,207 --> 00:43:05,917
Oh, shit!

792
00:43:07,836 --> 00:43:08,795
Milind.

793
00:43:08,878 --> 00:43:11,131
Go stand outside the hostel gate
and stay there.

794
00:43:11,298 --> 00:43:13,008
Keep an eye on things.

795
00:43:36,781 --> 00:43:38,742
Milind, what's the status?

796
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:40,618
I'm at the hostel's front gate.

797
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:42,662
There's a power cut.
No activity here.

798
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:44,581
-Stay alert!
 -Sir.

799
00:44:06,770 --> 00:44:07,937
Fuck!

800
00:44:12,025 --> 00:44:12,859
-Sir!
-Yes?

801
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:15,028
Sir, a van just passed 
 by from the side lane.

802
00:44:15,111 --> 00:44:16,154
What kind of van?

803
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,491
I ran behind it but 
 I couldn't see the number.

804
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:21,242
I'm damn sure Kareem was in it!

805
00:44:21,326 --> 00:44:23,661
-Kareem?
 -Yes, sir.

806
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:28,792
Sorry, sir.

807
00:44:31,211 --> 00:44:33,671
Why did you think we were being watched?

808
00:44:34,130 --> 00:44:36,508
A couple of days ago,
a tea stall suddenly popped up

809
00:44:36,591 --> 00:44:38,343
and then disappeared.

810
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,762
Did you see the van
outside gate number five?

811
00:44:40,845 --> 00:44:42,430
It's been there all this time.

812
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:44,224
There are cigarette butts
strewn all around it.

813
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,892
I might be overthinking it but...

814
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:47,602
I can't afford to take a risk.
