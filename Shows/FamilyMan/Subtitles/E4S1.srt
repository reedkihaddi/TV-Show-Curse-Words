1
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,775
Nissar.

2
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,155
Are you sure about the floor plan?

3
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,116
I got it from the builder directly.

4
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:34,410
-How did you get the guest list?
-That was easy.

5
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:35,745
It's a public event.

6
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,079
Did you see the guest list?

7
00:00:37,163 --> 00:00:38,748
Full of assholes.

8
00:00:38,831 --> 00:00:40,499
Those bastards won't know what hit them.

9
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:42,626
These bastards deserve this!

10
00:00:43,544 --> 00:00:45,087
Won't your uncle ask you about his van?

11
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:47,089
I've told him it's out for servicing.

12
00:00:47,173 --> 00:00:48,549
It'll be back in two or three days.

13
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:51,177
Only God knows what will
happen in two or three days.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,097
We'll wait here till the evening.

15
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,140
Okay, bhai.

16
00:00:56,223 --> 00:00:57,433
Are all your cell phones switched off?

17
00:00:57,516 --> 00:00:58,350
Yes, bhai.

18
00:00:59,185 --> 00:01:00,728
Their phones have been  
 off for quite some time.

19
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,438
The last known location was Bhendi Bazaar.

20
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,565
They must have gone underground.

21
00:01:04,982 --> 00:01:06,609
Any footage from the CCTV cameras
at the signal?

22
00:01:06,692 --> 00:01:07,568
Nothing, sir.

23
00:01:07,651 --> 00:01:09,653
There aren't too many cameras
in Bhendi Bazaar.

24
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:10,696
JK.

25
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:13,282
Tell Force One to send a unit
to Bhendi Bazaar.

26
00:01:13,365 --> 00:01:15,201
In civvies, no uniform.

27
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,163
Kareem.

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,418
Isn't it looking great?

29
00:01:24,835 --> 00:01:26,378
-It's fine.
 -Bhai!

30
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:28,506
The uniform is ready too.

31
00:01:29,048 --> 00:01:30,299
Shall we load the van?

32
00:01:30,633 --> 00:01:33,260
-Not now. Do it just before leaving.
-Okay.

33
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:36,472
Iqbal.

34
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:40,476
Are you out of your mind?

35
00:01:40,559 --> 00:01:42,228
Policemen will be checking us at the gate.

36
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:44,271
Those men
were just carrying mutton, Iqbal.

37
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,315
Didn't you see how they were slaughtered?

38
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:48,275
We can't go there unarmed.

39
00:01:48,359 --> 00:01:50,736
We'll hide it.

40
00:01:51,195 --> 00:01:53,322
Don't utter a word about this to Kareem.

41
00:01:53,405 --> 00:01:55,407
He'll chew my brains if he finds out.

42
00:01:56,575 --> 00:01:58,327
Did he know that somebody's 
 keeping an eye on him?

43
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:01,080
It's possible, sir.
It was such a sudden blackout.

44
00:02:01,163 --> 00:02:03,040
It was either pre-planned

45
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,417
or he's just plain lucky.

46
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,211
A man carries out a scooter blast

47
00:02:07,294 --> 00:02:09,463
and God knows what he's up to now!

48
00:02:09,922 --> 00:02:12,633
But all we know is that he's plain lucky!

49
00:02:15,427 --> 00:02:16,262
What's the next step?

50
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,931
We'll need a search warrant
as soon as possible.

51
00:02:19,265 --> 00:02:21,684
If we go through his room,
we might find something useful.

52
00:02:21,767 --> 00:02:24,603
-And if we find nothing?
-Then we have only one option, sir.

53
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:27,314
Evacuate Bhendi Bazaar.

54
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:11,567
Did you complete your English assignment?

55
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,862
-Mom, please!
-What do you mean by "Mom, please"?

56
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:16,739
Have you done it or not?

57
00:03:17,448 --> 00:03:19,658
Go sleep in your own bed!

58
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,917
Mom?

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,919
-Where's Papa?
-I don't know.

60
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:31,712
Has he gone to the office again?

61
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,088
Maybe.

62
00:03:33,172 --> 00:03:34,173
Mom?

63
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:36,050
If Dad works so hard,

64
00:03:36,634 --> 00:03:38,218
we should have more money.

65
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:40,095
We should be rich, no?

66
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:41,805
Shut up, idiot!

67
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:45,309
Excessive sleeping leads to a lower IQ.

68
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,394
Your IQ is low already.

69
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,188
At this rate, you'll have a negative IQ.

70
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:50,940
Get up! Get up!

71
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:52,399
Mom, do something!

72
00:03:52,483 --> 00:03:54,526
Please, let me sleep. I'll kill him.

73
00:03:54,818 --> 00:03:56,153
He's right.

74
00:03:56,278 --> 00:03:58,572
Excessive sleeping reduces brain cells.

75
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,783
-Come on, get up.
-Mom, it's a Sunday.

76
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:03,202
So what? Get up and
complete your assignment.

77
00:04:03,285 --> 00:04:06,080
Don't worry, it'll take me
only two minutes to finish it.

78
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:14,004
Which one's the smiley?

79
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:18,759
Show. I will show you.

80
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:20,010
Don't worry.

81
00:04:20,344 --> 00:04:22,513
-I'm not going to read your texts.
-It's okay.

82
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:32,606
I had my doubts, but...

83
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:42,992
Please, have a look.

84
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:45,911
Sir, I always knew...

85
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:48,914
Tell him to check under the bed.

86
00:04:49,123 --> 00:04:51,208
Check under the bed!

87
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,251
Quickly.

88
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:55,379
Tell him to check
the top of the bookshelf.

89
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:57,006
Check behind the books.

90
00:04:58,007 --> 00:04:59,633
-We've found the laptop, sir! 
 -Bring it here.

91
00:04:59,967 --> 00:05:01,135
Show me.

92
00:05:03,053 --> 00:05:04,346
Finally, dude.

93
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:35,210
Do you think I'm a terrorist?

94
00:05:38,172 --> 00:05:40,257
How does it matter?

95
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:42,801
It does matter.

96
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,180
Do you think I'm a bad man?

97
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:48,515
It doesn't make any difference to me

98
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,726
whether you're a good man or a bad one.

99
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:53,228
I'm a bad man.

100
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,940
I've done many horrible things.

101
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:02,821
I've sinned my entire life.

102
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,409
If I had a choice,

103
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,829
I would have changed everything.

104
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:24,718
Do you know what happens when
one reaches the ISIS camp?

105
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:29,681
They tear your passport
up and throw it away.

106
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,393
So that you rot there
for the rest of your life.

107
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,316
I had read so many things
about the Caliphate.

108
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,279
Rivers of milk and honey
flow in those lands.

109
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:46,240
The streets are paved with gold.

110
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:48,742
Only the will of Allah is obeyed.

111
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:52,204
There's no sadness.

112
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:54,873
There's only the light of God.

113
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:05,384
Those bastards made me do things.

114
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,805
Things I'm ashamed to even speak about.

115
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:14,059
And they claimed it was the will of Allah.

116
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,815
You...

117
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,275
You need to rest a bit.

118
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,194
You'll feel better when you rest.

119
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:26,655
What's the use of recovering physically?

120
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:32,953
What about the scars inside?
How will they heal?

121
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:57,936
You shouldn't be thinking
about what you've been through.

122
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:02,733
You need to strengthen yourself.
Don't worry about anything else.

123
00:08:02,816 --> 00:08:04,610
God will take care for you.

124
00:08:06,403 --> 00:08:08,113
Why will your God care for me?

125
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,531
I...

126
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,367
-Sorry.
-It's okay.

127
00:08:13,619 --> 00:08:15,704
I don't have any complaints
against your God.

128
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:18,540
In fact,

129
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:21,543
if your God can help me,

130
00:08:22,544 --> 00:08:24,129
please tell him to do it.

131
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,174
Because I really need help right now.

132
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,762
My mom thinks I'm still in the Gulf.

133
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:38,852
I don't mind if I die!

134
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:46,109
I want to see my mom just once.

135
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,751
When I come back,
I want to see the assignment done.

136
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,962
I just said I'll be back soon.

137
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:07,923
Don't think you can do whatever
you want when I'm not around.

138
00:09:08,257 --> 00:09:09,800
Do your assignment.

139
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:11,051
No arguments.

140
00:09:15,264 --> 00:09:18,308
I don't understand how people work,

141
00:09:18,392 --> 00:09:20,394
run their house, look after the kids

142
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,729
and still manage
to make time for themselves!

143
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,564
And you're already doing all of this.

144
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,777
So, where are you taking me?
Treat for your new job, right?

145
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,154
You should be treating me.
But that's later.

146
00:09:31,446 --> 00:09:33,115
Right now, we're going to celebrate.

147
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:36,076
Do you like Italian or...

148
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:37,244
I love Italian.

149
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,579
Then we're going to the perfect place.

150
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,844
It doesn't look like
you're going to work on an assignment.

151
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,804
Shut up! Mind your own business.

152
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:01,143
What's happening?
Can you access it or not?

153
00:10:01,226 --> 00:10:03,478
Sir, I just got it. I need a minute.

154
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:13,280
Sir, will you keep standing here?

155
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:15,657
Why?

156
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,327
It might take some time, that's why.

157
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,582
-Okay.
-Okay.

158
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:31,757
So, this is my favorite place.

159
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,134
Yeah, sure.

160
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:35,427
Hello.

161
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,555
Sorry, I wasn't able to call you.

162
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,516
I drifted off to sleep 
 while I was sitting.

163
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,185
It's okay.

164
00:10:43,310 --> 00:10:46,438
I am dying under all this paperwork.

165
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,357
My bosses have come down from Delhi.

166
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,441
Okay.

167
00:10:51,693 --> 00:10:53,612
-You were saying?
 -Saying what?

168
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,989
You texted that you wanted to speak.
Tell me.

169
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:57,824
I...

170
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:01,370
Nothing, we'll talk about it later.

171
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,538
Let's talk about it now. I'm free.

172
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:12,047
No. Nothing urgent.
Let's talk when I reach home.

173
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,467
-So, where are you now?
-Nearby.

174
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,052
I'd stepped out for some work.

175
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,470
I had some college work too.

176
00:11:18,553 --> 00:11:20,180
So, I thought I'll sit somewhere 
 and finish it off.

177
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:24,643
Anyway, listen, I'll call you later.

178
00:11:29,147 --> 00:11:30,941
I don't even know why I am lying to Sri?

179
00:11:43,078 --> 00:11:44,204
What's the problem now?

180
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:45,831
Suchi was lying.

181
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:47,332
Suchi!

182
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:49,418
She was hiding something.

183
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,920
You're getting paranoid for nothing.

184
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:53,630
No, no. Talpade.
I'm telling you the truth.

185
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,007
If a liar smells a lie,

186
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:57,300
then he must be right.

187
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:01,221
Did I say something wrong?

188
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:08,103
Ajit, I need to track this number.

189
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,271
Give it to me.

190
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,150
I need the last location.

191
00:12:13,442 --> 00:12:14,568
Tiwari, this is getting out of hand.

192
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:17,279
Is this personal?

193
00:12:17,362 --> 00:12:18,613
No. Tell me.

194
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,658
-Why do you make me do such things?
-Look, Tiwari!

195
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,035
You've neither eaten anything
nor slept since yesterday.

196
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,746
-Did you get it?
-Calm down!

197
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,040
-And please relax!
-It's in Mumbai itself.

198
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,625
Juhu. Hotel Sea Castle.

199
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:33,670
Hey, listen.

200
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,339
I'm going out for an hour.
Call me if anything comes up.

201
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,468
Listen! Even I'm coming along.

202
00:12:41,928 --> 00:12:45,223
-Just move it, fucker!
-Tiwari! Calm down.

203
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,019
This is not good for your blood pressure.

204
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:50,312
Shove it!

205
00:12:54,316 --> 00:12:56,318
I am telling you, you're making a mistake.

206
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:58,862
Your mind is playing tricks on you,
and you're letting it.

207
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,780
I didn't ask you to come along!

208
00:13:00,989 --> 00:13:03,533
You followed me like a faithful dog.

209
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,035
Now, just sit quietly!

210
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,496
Do you do this often?

211
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:10,248
I mean, sometimes.
But mostly by myself.

212
00:13:11,208 --> 00:13:13,502
Sometimes I come down and do some work.
Sometimes...

213
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,837
I just lounge around.

214
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,673
-You are living it up!
-What's wrong with that?

215
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,258
No, no. I'm serious.

216
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,469
We spend our entire lives thinking about

217
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,387
family, children, and society.

218
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,390
And if we ever think about ourselves,

219
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:29,059
then we drag ourselves down.

220
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,478
-Have your drink.
-Thanks.

221
00:13:36,441 --> 00:13:39,069
I don't even remember
the last time when I went out.

222
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:42,531
There was a time when I
used to explore new places

223
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,074
and travel around.

224
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,450
You know, I used to have a life.

225
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:47,244
It's not over yet.

226
00:13:51,456 --> 00:13:52,749
Tiwari, stop.

227
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,584
Tiwari!

228
00:13:57,629 --> 00:13:58,588
Tiwari!

229
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,384
There's still time, stop this.

230
00:14:02,676 --> 00:14:04,719
Tiwari, stop. Tiwari!

231
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:09,849
Get out of here.

232
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,227
-This is a family matter.
-But...

233
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,199
Shit!

234
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:29,035
They must be drinking coffee.

235
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,620
Shit! Tiwari.

236
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,247
Tiwari, don't do this!

237
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,748
-Let's talk.
-What?

238
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:36,543
Talk like we're discussing
something important.

239
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,546
Fucker, I've to talk to you
about something important.

240
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,674
About how you're hell-bent
on fucking up your marriage.

241
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,635
-Oh, yeah!
-No, no, bhai!

242
00:14:45,719 --> 00:14:48,054
Good afternoon, sir.
Would you like to go for brunch?

243
00:14:48,138 --> 00:14:51,391
No, no. Just a whiskey with soda and ice.

244
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:53,893
Sir, we also have an unlimited
drinks offer with brunch.

245
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,729
Get the brunch then...

246
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:58,023
What brunch? What's the price?

247
00:14:58,106 --> 00:15:00,358
Sir, for veg it is Rs. 2,799 plus taxes.

248
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:02,402
And non-veg is Rs. 3,299 plus taxes.

249
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,279
-Yeah, get it.
-You guys just want to fuck a man over!

250
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,073
Get a whiskey and an
orange juice, that's it.

251
00:15:07,157 --> 00:15:08,491
Sir, no brunch?

252
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,076
Look, man! We are poor people.

253
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,787
For the cost of a single brunch
we can eat lunch for a month.

254
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:16,541
Isn't it your...

255
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:19,628
Srikant!

256
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,671
-She's seen us.
-Oh, shit!

257
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:23,715
Do you want to invite him over?

258
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:30,930
What are you talking about...

259
00:15:31,014 --> 00:15:32,265
Oh, look at that!

260
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,809
Oh, shit! You're screwed now!

261
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:36,436
It's nothing, chill.

262
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,980
Looking nice, Suchi.

263
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:41,024
Why are you here?

264
00:15:41,107 --> 00:15:45,487
We had some work.

265
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,698
We got hungry
and decided to grab a bite here.

266
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,326
What are you doing here?
Didn't you have some work?

267
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:53,870
That's what I'm here for.
I'm meeting a friend.

268
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:56,206
We're discussing my new job.

269
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,250
It's a nice place

270
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,754
to discuss things.

271
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:05,965
Hi, Suchi!

272
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,427
What a surprise?

273
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,931
Would you

274
00:16:13,515 --> 00:16:15,850
like to meet Arvind?

275
00:16:15,934 --> 00:16:17,560
Why don't you come and say hi?

276
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:25,985
Isn't he the one who left his job
and joined the start-up?

277
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:32,075
Srikant, is that whiskey?

278
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,539
Do you regularly come here?

279
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,751
Where are the kids?

280
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,087
Don't worry. They're fine.

281
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,465
I can pick up or drop the kids
if you're too busy.

282
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:49,384
There's no need for that. Today is Sunday.

283
00:16:50,427 --> 00:16:51,261
Right.

284
00:16:52,929 --> 00:16:55,056
You continue your important discussion.

285
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:57,809
You must have important paperwork too.

286
00:16:57,892 --> 00:16:58,727
Carry on.

287
00:17:00,979 --> 00:17:02,188
-Cool.
-Cool.

288
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:09,988
-What happened?
-Fuck!

289
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,949
What happened?

290
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:28,715
Bye. Bye, Suchi.

291
00:17:43,146 --> 00:17:44,272
Thank you.

292
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:50,695
You'll sleep better
with Mother Mary watching over you.

293
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:58,536
Oh, sorry! I...

294
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,041
If it's a problem, I'll remove it.

295
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:05,293
No, no, let it be.

296
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:07,587
As it is,

297
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:09,506
everybody hates me.

298
00:18:10,673 --> 00:18:12,884
At least there's somebody
who cares about me.

299
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,719
Thank you.

300
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,763
Let her stay over here.

301
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:20,141
When this Mary is not around,

302
00:18:20,975 --> 00:18:22,268
Mother Mary will look after me.

303
00:18:31,653 --> 00:18:34,072
Please rest now.

304
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,272
-Yes, Pasha. What's happening?
 -Nothing yet.

305
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:08,648
We're wasting time.

306
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,359
We need to evacuate this entire place.

307
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,319
No, no. I'll let you know.

308
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:17,323
-Find anything?
-This encryption is very powerful.

309
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,908
It'll take some time.

310
00:19:19,534 --> 00:19:20,994
-Srikant!
-Yes, sir.

311
00:19:23,288 --> 00:19:25,456
We have to raise an alert soon
and evacuate the area.

312
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,125
-We don't have time!
-I understand, sir.

313
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,251
Give us some more time, sir.

314
00:19:28,334 --> 00:19:30,128
We're almost there. We are working on it!

315
00:19:37,719 --> 00:19:38,636
Take a right from there.

316
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,494
Guys, I'm in! I'm in!

317
00:20:03,578 --> 00:20:04,704
Come, Talpade!

318
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:18,676
There's been a lot of activity
on his blog,

319
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,886
email and YouTube.

320
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,888
There's also this video
that he watched, sir.

321
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:25,141
Whenever they begin to forget,

322
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,393
it becomes our duty  
 to show them their place in society.

323
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,895
That's MP Deshpande.

324
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,189
The time code tells us

325
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,525
Kareem saw this video
an hour after he used the drop box.

326
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:36,736
It's possible that he got this video
in the drop box.

327
00:20:36,819 --> 00:20:39,030
We can't keep waiting for the government.

328
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:40,281
Who's this Deshpande?

329
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,408
He runs an NGO
called "Cow Protection Force."

330
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,453
Where does he stay?

331
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,956
Near Bhendi Bazaar.

332
00:20:49,707 --> 00:20:52,168
There's a birthday party
at Deshpande's house today.

333
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,253
In an hour.

334
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,839
The guest list and floor plan
are of this party!

335
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,884
Let's go!

336
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:04,931
Pasha!

337
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,058
They're going to attack
MP Deshpande's house.

338
00:21:07,141 --> 00:21:08,935
We need to stop them 
 before they reach there.

339
00:21:09,018 --> 00:21:10,144
Copy.

340
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:11,938
Alert all units.

341
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,982
-The target is MP Deshpande.
-Yes, sir.

342
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,693
Are you absolutely sure?

343
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,988
Yes, sir. They have the guest list
and floor plan.

344
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:21,531
They're in a van.

345
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,449
And if my guess is right,

346
00:21:23,533 --> 00:21:25,368
there's something
very dangerous in that van.

347
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:27,120
The party is going to start now.

348
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:28,997
The attack can happen at any moment.

349
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:31,916
Srikant, you better be right about this.

350
00:21:33,668 --> 00:21:35,003
Step on it.

351
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:53,354
-What's the update?
-Suspects are in this area.

352
00:21:53,688 --> 00:21:55,064
We're tracking them.

353
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,735
If your intel is right,
they'll come through this road.

354
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,614
The rest of the units
are stationed at other intersections.

355
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:05,158
Let's see.

356
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:10,705
Iqbal!

357
00:22:11,914 --> 00:22:15,168
Easy, easy! Stay cool.

358
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,336
Shall we go?

359
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,715
Let's go.

360
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,532
-Where did these guys come from?
-Fuck! How did they know?

361
00:22:46,616 --> 00:22:49,660
I'm telling you, Kareem,
someone's out to fuck us!

362
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,329
Go, go, go!

363
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:53,790
Go, go, go!

364
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,084
-They will shoot us!
-Drive straight.

365
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,668
Stop! Stop!

366
00:22:57,752 --> 00:22:58,961
Back! Back!

367
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:00,922
Back! Quick!

368
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:03,758
Back! He will shoot us. Back! Back!

369
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,427
Go straight! Straight!

370
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:09,222
Go, go, go!

371
00:23:10,139 --> 00:23:11,516
Go!

372
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,559
-Kareem, I told you not to do it.
-Just, shut up!

373
00:23:13,643 --> 00:23:15,019
You told us nothing would go wrong.

374
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:16,479
Take a left!

375
00:23:16,687 --> 00:23:18,314
Left, left, left!

376
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,441
Shit! Drive back!

377
00:23:20,525 --> 00:23:21,984
They will shoot us.

378
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,486
I'm taking care of it. Just shut up!

379
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,071
Back! Back!

380
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:32,453
What's happening?

381
00:23:32,537 --> 00:23:34,622
They're chasing us.

382
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,415
Shut up!

383
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,544
I don't know how this happened.

384
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:41,587
Take a left!

385
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:46,467
They're going to kill us.

386
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:48,719
-Take left!
-Nothing will happen.

387
00:23:48,803 --> 00:23:50,680
Drive straight!

388
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,807
I know they're going to kill us!

389
00:23:52,890 --> 00:23:54,100
Shut up!

390
00:23:56,144 --> 00:23:58,354
-Take a right!
-Take a right!

391
00:24:00,148 --> 00:24:01,399
Oh, shit!

392
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:02,567
I'll get these bastards...

393
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:04,527
-Hey, what're you doing?
-Let those motherfuckers come!

394
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:05,945
Come here, motherfucker!

395
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:07,530
Hey, Nissar! Have you lost you mind?

396
00:24:07,613 --> 00:24:09,115
Nissar!

397
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,618
-Come, you motherfuckers!
-Nissar!

398
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,705
Fuck!

399
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:19,750
Fuck!

400
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:20,353
And we get justice.

401
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,396
I love you, Jonali.

402
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:46,355
Hey, who's there?

403
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,386
Sir, the target is in sight. May I shoot?

404
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,513
Take the shot!

405
00:27:40,618 --> 00:27:41,660
He's dead.

406
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:03,599
Open it.

407
00:28:15,152 --> 00:28:16,237
JK, sir.

408
00:28:16,737 --> 00:28:17,655
Yes, tell me.

409
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:19,615
Come here, sir. You need to see this.

410
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:33,212
-What is it?
-See for yourself.

411
00:28:41,262 --> 00:28:42,680
It's beef, sir.

412
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,848
Beef!

413
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,058
Beef!

414
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,685
So this was their plan?

415
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,564
To feed beef to Deshpande.

416
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:52,982
This is just...

417
00:28:55,192 --> 00:28:56,277
Shit!

418
00:28:57,194 --> 00:28:59,071
Why the hell did they have guns?

419
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:01,157
Sir, only one of them had a gun.

420
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,660
Shit!

421
00:29:16,505 --> 00:29:20,843
If word gets out,
TASC will be shut down permanently.

422
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,265
Sir, it's my fault.

423
00:29:26,348 --> 00:29:28,559
-I take responsibility.
-What?

424
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:31,520
What difference will it make?

425
00:29:57,338 --> 00:29:58,714
Okay, guys. Listen.

426
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:02,676
It was a terrorist attack.

427
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,641
We had intel that they were
going to attack Deshpande.

428
00:30:09,225 --> 00:30:12,478
We warned them and gave them
a chance to surrender.

429
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:14,980
But they fired at us.

430
00:30:16,440 --> 00:30:18,108
All three died in the encounter.

431
00:30:18,943 --> 00:30:20,277
That's the story.

432
00:30:20,945 --> 00:30:23,697
Sir! That's...

433
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:27,993
Do you have any other solution?

434
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:31,121
We've made a mistake.
Now is the time for damage control.

435
00:30:32,122 --> 00:30:35,209
Your accepting responsibility
is not going to help.

436
00:30:36,794 --> 00:30:38,337
Am I clear?

437
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,094
Yes, sir!

438
00:31:28,262 --> 00:31:29,513
I'm coming!

439
00:31:35,686 --> 00:31:38,314
Sorry, I forgot the keys.

440
00:31:38,647 --> 00:31:40,816
-It's four in the morning!
-Sorry.

441
00:31:52,494 --> 00:31:54,121
What was the need to drink so much?

442
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:56,081
Come on, Suchi. Please!

443
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,668
Have you been drinking since afternoon?

444
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:02,212
Suchi, be quiet, please!

445
00:32:03,464 --> 00:32:05,591
Go, sleep!

446
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,477
Sleep, sleep!

447
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:19,730
Don't you want to say anything?

448
00:32:21,774 --> 00:32:22,608
What?

449
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,694
About the fact that I went out for coffee?

450
00:32:27,071 --> 00:32:28,197
No!

451
00:32:29,698 --> 00:32:31,784
About the fact that you hid it from me.

452
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:35,371
You lied to me.

453
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:38,624
Sri, you, of all people,
shouldn't preach about not lying, okay?

454
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:43,003
No, no. Don't change the subject.

455
00:32:45,673 --> 00:32:48,050
We are talking about you now.

456
00:32:48,425 --> 00:32:49,802
What about me?

457
00:32:50,552 --> 00:32:53,931
I'd gone to meet a colleague
and discuss a new job opportunity.

458
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,518
What is it with this new job?

459
00:32:57,685 --> 00:33:00,229
That you want to give up everything

460
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:02,106
to run after it.

461
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,401
If you had ever tried to understand me,

462
00:33:05,484 --> 00:33:07,611
then you wouldn't be
asking me this question today.

463
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,199
-I am asking you now!
-Sri!

464
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:13,951
I am tired!

465
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,452
I've been leading
my life for fifteen years

466
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:16,912
for you and the kids.

467
00:33:17,204 --> 00:33:18,997
If I'm trying to do something new,

468
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:20,582
then what is the problem with that?

469
00:33:21,834 --> 00:33:24,712
Arvind has left college
and joined a good company.

470
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,046
And he's asked me to come along with him.

471
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,132
That's what we were discussing.

472
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:30,968
Arvind has joined a new company.

473
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,762
So now the company is good.

474
00:33:35,264 --> 00:33:37,433
Arvind has left his college job...

475
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,309
So now the college is bad.

476
00:33:39,727 --> 00:33:41,770
Who the hell is this Arvind?

477
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:43,480
-Sri, come on...
-No, no.

478
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:50,195
It was such a beautiful place
to discuss a job.

479
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:55,284
-Seaside, romantic brunch, right?
-What?

480
00:33:57,494 --> 00:34:00,080
How did you find out
where I was at that moment?

481
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,417
-Were you tracking me?
-Bullshit!

482
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,918
Like you track those criminals?

483
00:34:05,002 --> 00:34:09,506
Nonsense! You're talking bullshit!

484
00:34:10,132 --> 00:34:11,759
You're impossible!

485
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:14,178
I just don't want to talk to you!

486
00:34:18,682 --> 00:34:21,018
You always say,

487
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:23,896
"We don't talk, we don't talk."

488
00:34:24,897 --> 00:34:26,607
So what are we doing now?

489
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:29,735
-I am talking to you right now!
-Lower your voice, Srikant!

490
00:34:30,986 --> 00:34:34,698
There's a point in talking
only if there's mutual respect.

491
00:34:36,158 --> 00:34:38,327
What have I ever done to listen to this?

492
00:34:40,537 --> 00:34:42,039
Oh, right!

493
00:34:42,122 --> 00:34:47,169
I haven't taken you out for coffee
to a five-star hotel.

494
00:34:49,630 --> 00:34:52,508
I haven't taken you for exotic holidays.

495
00:34:53,509 --> 00:34:56,470
I have never given you expensive gifts.

496
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:01,391
If it were possible, I would have done it!

497
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:04,520
Have I ever asked you for anything?

498
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:08,065
Never have I asked you
for something we couldn't afford.

499
00:35:09,149 --> 00:35:11,485
Don't make me sound
like a bloody gold-digger!

500
00:35:14,905 --> 00:35:16,073
I'm a loser.

501
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:20,077
I'm a loser.

502
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:23,872
Everyone keeps reminding me.

503
00:35:26,542 --> 00:35:28,794
My mother, my brother...

504
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:31,296
Keep reminding me.

505
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,925
Your father thinks

506
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:36,385
I'm a loser.

507
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:38,720
You think

508
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,806
I'm a loser.

509
00:35:43,225 --> 00:35:47,729
My kids, too, think I'm a loser.

510
00:35:48,730 --> 00:35:49,690
Sri,

511
00:35:49,982 --> 00:35:51,817
every time the same thing?

512
00:35:53,026 --> 00:35:54,820
Why does everything ultimately have to be

513
00:35:54,903 --> 00:35:56,572
about you and your important job?

514
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,866
Enough is enough!

515
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:00,868
I'm sick and tired of this self-pity!

516
00:36:00,951 --> 00:36:02,286
Tired of it?

517
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,746
Then why are you still with me?

518
00:36:05,831 --> 00:36:06,832
Why don't you leave me?

519
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:09,251
Because I used to think
that whatever happens

520
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:12,880
your family is important to you too!

521
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:17,467
But I don't know any more.

522
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,974
Oh, and by the way,

523
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,351
I've said yes to the job.

524
00:36:34,943 --> 00:36:37,821
Atthu, go inside, please. Yes.

525
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,183
Papa!

526
00:37:07,476 --> 00:37:08,769
Papa!

527
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,605
Dhriti, Atharv, let's go. Come on.

528
00:37:36,797 --> 00:37:38,256
We have just received some huge news.

529
00:37:38,423 --> 00:37:41,510
A terrorist attack was planned 
 on MP Deshpande's house.

530
00:37:41,677 --> 00:37:43,929
But our vigilant forces 
 stopped it in time.

531
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:45,305
The terrorists were not from Pakistan.

532
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,641
They were three students 
 from Victoria College, Mumbai.

533
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:49,810
Arms and ammunition were recovered...

534
00:37:49,893 --> 00:37:51,687
-No, hold on! Listen to me. 
 -I just...

535
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,271
Let me get this straight here.

536
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:56,400
-You think that these three terrorists... 
 -Terrorists!

537
00:37:56,733 --> 00:37:59,194
Anurag, they're students.

538
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,947
-We don't have proof. 
 -Soldiers are dying every day.

539
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,741
You should question the government 
 if they have the proof!

540
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:07,452
-Proof. You want proof? 
 -Yes!

541
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:09,162
I will give you the evidence.

542
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:12,249
The evidence is that this guy 
 whose name is Kareem

543
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:13,583
who you think is innocent.

544
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:15,877
He refused to stand up 
 for the national anthem.

545
00:38:15,961 --> 00:38:17,963
-Isn't this proof... 
 -Are you serious?

546
00:38:18,046 --> 00:38:20,007
If he didn't stand up 
 for the national anthem,

547
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:21,967
you declare him a terrorist?

548
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,929
Anurag, come on! How can you say 
 that these innocent students...

549
00:38:32,936 --> 00:38:34,021
Easy there.

550
00:38:37,232 --> 00:38:39,151
Cool down a bit now.

551
00:38:41,319 --> 00:38:43,113
Look, it was a collective failure.

552
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,365
Everybody is at fault.

553
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:47,784
And if everyone messed up,

554
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:49,202
then don't blame just yourself.

555
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:00,380
If Kareem was not a terrorist,

556
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,634
then why did he use the drop box?

557
00:39:11,933 --> 00:39:13,810
And why that drop box?

558
00:39:16,396 --> 00:39:17,856
Why just that one?

559
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,365
Maybe someone set him up.

560
00:39:33,121 --> 00:39:35,040
I don't understand.

561
00:39:38,668 --> 00:39:41,088
The biggest fuck-up is...

562
00:39:44,257 --> 00:39:48,011
We know nothing about
that fucking scooter-bomber.

563
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,397
Good.

564
00:40:00,148 --> 00:40:01,316
Good.

565
00:40:01,817 --> 00:40:03,235
Your luck is good.

566
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:06,404
But your Allah won't be there every time.

567
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:08,698
But I'll be there.

568
00:40:09,032 --> 00:40:11,993
Watching, like a CCTV camera. 24/7.

569
00:40:13,203 --> 00:40:17,874
Diwali, Dusshera, Holi, Navratri,
if anything happens,

570
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:21,378
I'll make you dance to my tunes.
Now, get lost.
