1
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:25,234
As-salaam alaikum, Sajid.

2
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,987
Wa alaykumu as-salam.

3
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,155
Altaf Bhai!

4
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,785
You got out.
You should be thanking us.

5
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:36,162
What for?

6
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,664
For saving you from the police.

7
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,834
But why?

8
00:00:42,585 --> 00:00:45,212
-What did I do to--
-Faizan Bhai sends his regards.

9
00:00:47,089 --> 00:00:49,467
He has big plans for you.

10
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:53,345
He doesn't want you caught
for petty IED blasts.

11
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,306
That's why he asked
me to bail you out.

12
00:00:55,389 --> 00:00:58,309
-They had no evidence against me.
-Why take a chance?

13
00:00:58,434 --> 00:00:59,935
That's why we put Kareem as bait.

14
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,813
-To get their eyes off of you.
-Kareem?

15
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,523
Kareem Bhat?

16
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:06,525
We knew those software idiots

17
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:08,944
would spill the beans about the drop box.

18
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,781
So, we sent them on the wrong trail.

19
00:01:11,864 --> 00:01:13,407
What happened to him?

20
00:01:13,491 --> 00:01:14,658
He was martyred.

21
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,204
It was tragic.
But there was no other way.

22
00:01:18,287 --> 00:01:20,289
We led him to the drop box.

23
00:01:20,372 --> 00:01:23,501
Whatever happened after that
was on him.

24
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,378
What does Faizan Bhai 
want from me?

25
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,422
Only he knows that.

26
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,591
But he did say that...

27
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,136
after this, people will consider
the 26/11 attacks, child's play.

28
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:36,430
Get some rest.

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,098
And don't go back to the hostel.

30
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:40,100
Look for a new place to stay.

31
00:01:40,184 --> 00:01:42,978
I'll meet you again.
 Allah hafiz.

32
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:45,231
Allah hafiz.

33
00:02:27,731 --> 00:02:29,650
-What's his FiO2?
-Sir, sixty.

34
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:31,485
-Make it thirty please.
-Yes, sir.

35
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:33,612
-Call Dr. Patel immediately.
-Yes, sir.

36
00:02:33,696 --> 00:02:36,156
And you, inform the ATS, please.

37
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,680
We had information

38
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:03,726
that a drop box was being used
for terrorist activities.

39
00:03:05,394 --> 00:03:08,022
Kareem used that drop box.

40
00:03:09,315 --> 00:03:11,650
And you found out about this drop box

41
00:03:11,734 --> 00:03:13,485
through the three IT employees...

42
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:16,989
you had arrested at their office.

43
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:18,282
Is that right?

44
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:19,450
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:22,995
They individually confirmed this.

46
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:27,958
Did you think that this
drop box could be used

47
00:03:28,042 --> 00:03:31,587
by a person not involved
in terrorist activities?

48
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,424
Well...

49
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,843
It didn't occur to me then.

50
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,304
What do you think now?

51
00:03:40,387 --> 00:03:43,182
Now... I think that...

52
00:03:45,309 --> 00:03:47,061
somebody deliberately...

53
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:49,897
made Kareem...

54
00:03:51,815 --> 00:03:54,109
use that drop box.

55
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:56,487
I think he was framed.

56
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:57,947
Framed?

57
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:01,909
Was there any evidence
against Kareem

58
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,745
besides the fact that
he used that drop box?

59
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,080
This is...

60
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,582
Standard Operating Procedure, sir.

61
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:13,879
We often need to take action
based on little evidence.

62
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:16,590
The suspect was kept under surveillance.

63
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,093
What did you find?

64
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,094
Actually,

65
00:04:20,177 --> 00:04:23,305
we heard Kareem talking
to two of his associates.

66
00:04:23,764 --> 00:04:25,599
-Iqbal and Nissar.
-Yes, sir.

67
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:28,811
They were planning to
attack MP Deshpande.

68
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:32,648
It's written here that
you heard them discussing

69
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:37,069
about a van, a guest list
and a floor plan.

70
00:04:37,152 --> 00:04:40,698
Yes, sir.
We thought they were...

71
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:43,158
going to launch an attack.

72
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,576
The only difference is

73
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:48,414
you didn't know it was
this sort of an attack.

74
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,834
-Right, sir.
-Mr. Sharma's report mentions that

75
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:54,169
Kareem was never officially arrested.

76
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,130
But he was always
under surveillance

77
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:57,423
because of his actions.

78
00:04:57,506 --> 00:05:00,050
Throwing ink on a politician,

79
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,553
writing anti-government blogs...

80
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:04,596
Is that right, Mr. Srikant?

81
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,225
Yes, sir.

82
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:10,227
But our actions are never based

83
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,480
on a person's political views.

84
00:05:13,689 --> 00:05:15,441
Mr. Sharma, what is your assessment?

85
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:18,610
Sir, my assessment remains the same.

86
00:05:19,111 --> 00:05:20,946
Srikant is very impulsive.

87
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,990
He gets carried away.

88
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,700
And sometimes, he doesn't follow rules.

89
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:27,953
He makes decisions without
bothering about the process.

90
00:05:28,037 --> 00:05:31,081
In some cases,
his approach has benefited us.

91
00:05:31,623 --> 00:05:36,170
Yet, we can't keep
overlooking his mistakes.

92
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,921
But in this case, sir...

93
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,716
the evidence against
Kareem and his associates

94
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,260
was sufficient enough to act upon.

95
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,687
So, what we gather, Mr. Srikant

96
00:05:54,063 --> 00:05:56,273
is that you had a suspect

97
00:05:56,774 --> 00:05:58,650
who had
anti-government views.

98
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,652
He used a terrorist drop box

99
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:04,073
and planned an attack
on an MP with his associates.

100
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,200
In such little time, it was impossible

101
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:10,079
for your team to figure out
what the attack was.

102
00:06:10,329 --> 00:06:11,455
-Yes, sir.
-We believe that

103
00:06:11,538 --> 00:06:16,376
you had a valid
reason to target Kareem.

104
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,253
And as far as...

105
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,172
their shooting is concerned.

106
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,759
It looks like a Force One call
and not TASC's.

107
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:26,512
Force One commander
Pasha and his team

108
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,181
got carried away and shot them.

109
00:06:31,683 --> 00:06:33,352
So, Mr. Srikant

110
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,896
the decision to
shoot was Force One's.

111
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:37,314
Is that right?

112
00:06:47,491 --> 00:06:49,993
This was my operation.

113
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:53,497
Every decision taken...

114
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:55,958
was mine.

115
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,130
Whatever happened...

116
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,717
If someone should be held responsible...

117
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,178
then...

118
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,557
I should be held responsible.

119
00:07:45,924 --> 00:07:47,593
It will hurt a bit.

120
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:49,261
But you'll get better soon.

121
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:54,141
Oh! Your friend...

122
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:56,351
regained consciousness today.

123
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:58,979
How is he?

124
00:08:00,063 --> 00:08:02,232
He regained consciousness

125
00:08:02,566 --> 00:08:04,109
but then fell unconscious again.

126
00:08:04,443 --> 00:08:06,987
The doctor says he'll recover soon.

127
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:09,615
Inshallah!

128
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,783
I had lost all hope.

129
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:15,037
This wound has healed.

130
00:08:15,329 --> 00:08:17,331
It won't hurt much now.

131
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,209
The doctor says
you'll be discharged soon.

132
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,405
Let me...

133
00:09:56,138 --> 00:09:58,015
-As-salaam alaikum 
 -Wa alaykumu as-salam.

134
00:09:58,098 --> 00:09:59,057
Come in.

135
00:09:59,558 --> 00:10:01,351
Have you heard of Basharat Ali?

136
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:03,645
Kashmir!

137
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,939
He's waiting for you in Srinagar.

138
00:10:10,152 --> 00:10:11,320
What happened?

139
00:10:12,738 --> 00:10:14,698
It's been ages since I went to Srinagar.

140
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:19,745
The city reminds me of my little brother.

141
00:10:21,246 --> 00:10:22,998
He was fourteen...

142
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,168
when these bastards shot him.

143
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,545
He was returning from school.

144
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,213
He saw a procession.

145
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,757
People were raising slogans.

146
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,300
He joined them.

147
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:37,804
It was a peaceful procession
from Lal Chowk to Jama Masjid.

148
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,682
No stone-pelting, no furor, nothing.

149
00:10:42,893 --> 00:10:44,603
We have faced many atrocities.

150
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,188
But we'll avenge them all.

151
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:50,442
And Allah has chosen you
for this mission.

152
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,878
-What is this?
-A ticket to Srinagar.

153
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:11,963
You'll need to leave soon.

154
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,178
-Who else is involved in this mission...
-Mission Zulfiqar.

155
00:11:19,513 --> 00:11:20,889
Nobody knows anything.

156
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,227
Don't take this
the wrong way, Altaf Bhai.

157
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,437
But I know nothing
about this mission.

158
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,356
And I work on my own terms.

159
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:31,024
That's why, before I do anything

160
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:33,026
I want to speak to Faizan Bhai.

161
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:35,362
Each of us have been given a task.

162
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:40,659
We get orders and we do
what has been asked of us.

163
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:43,328
I was told to meet you and I did that.

164
00:11:43,412 --> 00:11:45,580
That's all they asked of me.

165
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,792
Basharat's number is fed into this phone.

166
00:11:49,292 --> 00:11:50,544
Speak to him.

167
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:54,673
If Sharma finds out
we're in the hospital

168
00:11:54,756 --> 00:11:56,299
he'll suspend us.

169
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,218
It's an ongoing investigation.

170
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:01,388
We can do our job till then.

171
00:12:02,097 --> 00:12:03,598
As soon as Asif regains consciousness

172
00:12:03,682 --> 00:12:04,933
we'll start grilling him.

173
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:07,519
Nobody knows anything
about Mission Zulfiqar.

174
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,771
Except him.

175
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,025
Tiwari, we're not in a
position to give orders.

176
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,279
Sharma has issued a memo
and screwed everyone.

177
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:18,697
Hello, Doctor.

178
00:12:18,989 --> 00:12:19,865
Hi.

179
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:21,074
What's the update?

180
00:12:21,158 --> 00:12:22,659
He had regained
consciousness a while ago.

181
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:23,743
I think he's stable now.

182
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:26,997
But it will take time
for him to talk.

183
00:12:27,998 --> 00:12:29,291
Is he still under danger?

184
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,460
No, he'll live.

185
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:32,836
And one more thing.

186
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,880
The one who was shot in the arm...

187
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,214
Moosa.

188
00:12:36,465 --> 00:12:39,217
-His name is Moosa Rahman.
-Yes, him.

189
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,261
He's fine now.
He's in a bit of pain

190
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:44,014
but we can discharge
him very soon.

191
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,641
Okay.

192
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,768
Thanks.

193
00:12:50,479 --> 00:12:52,397
You wait here.
I'll be back.

194
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:57,277
Rest as much as you want to.

195
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,447
The doctor said
you'll be fine soon.

196
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:02,908
Once you are discharged...

197
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:07,621
you won't be getting this royal treatment.

198
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,915
Tell me something important

199
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:13,543
or get ready for some
intensive care by the police.

200
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,754
Think!

201
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,964
Think fast!

202
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,716
I'll be back.

203
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,774
Atharv.

204
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:38,944
Hello! Atharv!

205
00:13:39,736 --> 00:13:41,238
Put that mouth organ down.

206
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:15,897
Mom!

207
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,025
I need the laptop.
Are you going to take long?

208
00:14:19,109 --> 00:14:21,486
Yes. Use your notebook.

209
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,864
Come on, Mom!
This is so annoying!

210
00:14:25,031 --> 00:14:26,116
What?

211
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,451
What did you say?

212
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,519
What are you doing?

213
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,939
Fixing the house.

214
00:14:58,023 --> 00:14:59,149
Oh, God!

215
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,192
Is everyone going crazy in this house?

216
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:03,028
This is so annoying!

217
00:15:16,207 --> 00:15:17,417
Atharv.

218
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,919
Atharv!

219
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,630
Stop it.

220
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,649
May I come in, sir?

221
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,237
No, it's alright, sir.

222
00:15:46,655 --> 00:15:48,907
You just had to agree with them.

223
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:51,201
They already said

224
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:53,662
that the three deaths were
Force One's fault.

225
00:15:53,745 --> 00:15:55,538
They were looking to clear you!

226
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,001
Sir, I was responsible for the operation

227
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:02,087
-so the consequences--
-I know.

228
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,214
And yes, there are consequences.

229
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:07,634
You're being transferred to Srinagar.

230
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:11,638
Temporarily.

231
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:14,182
The lead analyst there
is on maternity leave.

232
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,143
She'll be back in a few months
and so will you.

233
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,063
You're lucky you haven't been suspended.

234
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,358
If it had been anyone else

235
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,068
he'd be packing his bags by now.

236
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:27,195
Thank you, sir.
Thank you for your support.

237
00:16:27,278 --> 00:16:29,030
Don't thank me.
Thank Kulkarni.

238
00:16:29,114 --> 00:16:30,615
He spoke to the officers

239
00:16:30,699 --> 00:16:32,575
and set things up for you.

240
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:56,433
What's the bloody hurry?

241
00:17:19,831 --> 00:17:21,499
You! You there!

242
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,168
I was about to park.
Take your car out.

243
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,294
Sir, I parked already.

244
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,504
-You can park is elsewhere.
-You don't seem to get it.

245
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:28,006
Take your car out!

246
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:30,759
Your blood pressure will soar, sir.

247
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,135
What did you just say?

248
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,057
Get up! You bastard!

249
00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:43,313
-How dare you!
-Dad!

250
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,440
What are you doing?

251
00:17:45,648 --> 00:17:47,609
Nothing.
We were just playing.

252
00:17:49,068 --> 00:17:50,445
That's my son.
Say hello.

253
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:52,113
Go on!

254
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:54,449
-Say hello!
-Hello!

255
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,159
We were just playing.

256
00:17:57,035 --> 00:17:58,703
Get out of here.

257
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,836
Don't tell Mom.

258
00:18:07,629 --> 00:18:08,713
What?

259
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,133
I'm talking about what you saw.

260
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,971
-Hello?
-What?

261
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:19,015
You have to say, "Okay, Dad."

262
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:21,810
I'm craving pizza.

263
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,230
You ate pizza this Saturday!

264
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:26,773
I feel like having it again.

265
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:31,569
-Okay, I'll get you some tomorrow.
-I want it now.

266
00:18:48,086 --> 00:18:49,796
Why did he get pizza?

267
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,423
I never get some when I ask for it!

268
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,801
-Do you want to eat pizza?
-Yes.

269
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:57,011
No problem.

270
00:18:57,512 --> 00:18:59,764
Dad, an ice cream too.

271
00:19:00,557 --> 00:19:02,267
The shop's on the way.

272
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,686
Sure, son, why not!

273
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:05,895
Hold on a second.

274
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:08,857
You're agreeing to
all his demands!

275
00:19:08,940 --> 00:19:12,110
-What do you have against me?
-Nothing, my dear.

276
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:14,195
Do you want an ice cream too?

277
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:16,865
You can also have one.

278
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,058
-Hello, Sri.
 -Hello, sir.

279
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:45,310
Sir...

280
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,771
can I disturb you for a minute?

281
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,148
Tell me.

282
00:19:53,151 --> 00:19:56,112
Sir, I think I've
made a huge mistake.

283
00:19:56,195 --> 00:20:00,325
Sri, you know I trust 
 your judgement.

284
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm a little surprised that...

285
00:20:03,161 --> 00:20:04,621
you made such a mistake.

286
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:09,375
Sir, I'm upset about the fact
that not only did we kill them...

287
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:13,171
we also destroyed their reputation.

288
00:20:13,254 --> 00:20:15,006
Sir, they were not terrorists.

289
00:20:16,591 --> 00:20:19,385
Their families deserve to know this.

290
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:21,054
Because now...

291
00:20:21,888 --> 00:20:24,432
the world will taunt them all their lives.

292
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:29,020
Sir, I think I should tell the truth.

293
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,188
I'm ready to 
 face the consequences.

294
00:20:30,271 --> 00:20:31,314
Don't do it, Sri.

295
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:32,649
Sir, we...

296
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,859
Actually, I...

297
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,527
murdered them.

298
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,905
Listen, Sri. Calm down.

299
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:43,868
If you tell the world that you 
 murdered three innocent boys,

300
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:45,578
it will be a disaster.

301
00:20:45,995 --> 00:20:48,289
The media, human rights groups...

302
00:20:48,957 --> 00:20:50,291
They will be all over us.

303
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:54,462
This will totally undermine 
 our fight against terrorism.

304
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,006
Please see the big picture.

305
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,425
I don't know who is wrong, sir.

306
00:20:59,509 --> 00:21:01,761
There seems to be no difference
between them and us.

307
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,262
There's a very big difference.

308
00:21:04,138 --> 00:21:09,268
And the difference is that
they need to win only once.

309
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,438
But we have to win every time.

310
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:15,817
We're at war, Sri.

311
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:16,544
Kareem was not a terrorist.

312
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:41,277
Please.

313
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,997
What are you doing, Tiwari?

314
00:22:53,331 --> 00:22:54,665
Take it easy, buddy.

315
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,670
Don't you want a drink?

316
00:23:05,635 --> 00:23:08,346
Years ago, my father threw
me out of the house.

317
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:10,473
You know why?

318
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:16,104
He thought I was killing my
Muslim brothers in the name of duty.

319
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:19,482
He said that if I side with the infidels

320
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,943
Allah will send me to hell.

321
00:23:23,361 --> 00:23:24,821
You know what I told him?

322
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,533
I said, "Dad, go fuck yourself."

323
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:33,538
I'm not killing my brothers.
I'm killing terrorists.

324
00:23:33,996 --> 00:23:37,083
They murder innocents.

325
00:23:39,794 --> 00:23:40,711
And today...

326
00:23:41,587 --> 00:23:43,464
I have murdered innocents.

327
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,638
-We're all murderers.
-Yes.

328
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:53,099
And now...

329
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,143
I'm left with neither work,
nor respect.

330
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:57,812
Will you two stop being
melodramatic, please?

331
00:23:58,646 --> 00:24:00,565
You screwed up.
You screwed up.

332
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,316
We all screwed up!

333
00:24:02,859 --> 00:24:04,110
We're all killers!

334
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,070
But it was a mistake.

335
00:24:06,154 --> 00:24:07,905
Nobody killed them on purpose.

336
00:24:08,281 --> 00:24:10,116
It doesn't matter.

337
00:24:11,033 --> 00:24:12,493
We killed them.

338
00:24:12,702 --> 00:24:14,412
And now we're defaming them.

339
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,164
Everybody's calling them terrorists.

340
00:24:16,414 --> 00:24:18,875
We need to tell their parents...

341
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,668
that their children were not terrorists.

342
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:24,046
We fucked up.

343
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:27,300
But it is a question
of national security!

344
00:24:27,383 --> 00:24:29,802
-So the truth can take a flying fuck?
-No!

345
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:33,014
There's the truth.

346
00:24:34,974 --> 00:24:36,809
And then, there's the country.

347
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:40,897
Please don't make any hasty decisions.

348
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:42,690
You mean suicide?

349
00:24:44,192 --> 00:24:45,985
I'm a Force One commando.

350
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,946
-Don't worry about me.
-That's not what I meant.

351
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:50,615
When did I say so?

352
00:24:50,698 --> 00:24:52,617
This is getting too depressing!

353
00:25:05,046 --> 00:25:06,339
What are you doing?

354
00:25:06,422 --> 00:25:08,341
You both are not asleep yet?

355
00:25:09,133 --> 00:25:10,009
No.

356
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:11,260
Of course he followed you here.

357
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,970
Don't you have school tomorrow?

358
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:14,597
Why aren't you asleep yet?

359
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,432
Don't you have college tomorrow?

360
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,352
Tomorrow...

361
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,896
No, I quit my job at the college.

362
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:23,648
I got a new job.

363
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:26,275
-What? When?
-What? When?

364
00:25:26,359 --> 00:25:28,903
-You didn't even tell us!
-You didn't even tell us!

365
00:25:29,153 --> 00:25:30,571
I'm telling you now!

366
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:32,657
-Only after I asked you.
-Only after I asked you.

367
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,242
You treat me like a child!

368
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:37,245
Suchi, you should
have told me at least.

369
00:25:37,328 --> 00:25:39,038
And what is this new job about?

370
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:41,207
Relax! I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

371
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,375
Now go to sleep!

372
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,418
Okay, Suchi.
Let's have a chat tomorrow.

373
00:25:44,502 --> 00:25:46,128
Hey! Run along!

374
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:48,047
I'll be there in five minutes
to check on you.

375
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:51,133
-I'll whack you if you're not in bed.
-I love you too, Suchi.

376
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,196
Moosa?

377
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,075
What happened?
Are you in pain?

378
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:19,245
I'll ask the doctor to
give you more painkillers.

379
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,206
What happened to you?

380
00:26:22,331 --> 00:26:24,125
I don't want to get better.

381
00:26:24,542 --> 00:26:26,877
You can't stay forever in the hospital.

382
00:26:28,296 --> 00:26:29,922
If I recover...

383
00:26:30,298 --> 00:26:33,175
they will throw me inside the jail.

384
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,887
They will kill me, Mary.

385
00:26:37,221 --> 00:26:38,472
Don't think about such things.

386
00:26:38,556 --> 00:26:40,266
God is with you.

387
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,476
I don't know about God.

388
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:47,815
But thank God you are with me.

389
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:53,529
I'm telling you, everything will be okay.

390
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,532
Have faith in God.

391
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:58,177
It's my mother's birthday tomorrow.

392
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,971
Our birthdays are on the same day.

393
00:28:04,725 --> 00:28:08,979
We used to celebrate every year.

394
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,689
Mom would cook for us.

395
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,652
Chicken rice, beef...

396
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,696
Prawn curry is my favorite.

397
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,619
Dad used to visit the north.

398
00:28:24,286 --> 00:28:26,497
He had learnt how to cook paratha.

399
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:32,294
All of us would sit in a circle
and eat together.

400
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:39,385
Dad would tell us stories
about places he had visited.

401
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,220
Rajasthan.

402
00:28:41,804 --> 00:28:43,055
Punjab.

403
00:28:44,348 --> 00:28:45,724
Gujarat.

404
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:54,900
I am sure they must be missing you.

405
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,655
Your sister must be in college, right?

406
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:01,407
She's dead.

407
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,702
They killed her.

408
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:07,913
Dad too.

409
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,584
Only Mom is alive.

410
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,086
She must be all alone.

411
00:29:17,381 --> 00:29:20,968
And I won't be able to wish her!

412
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:34,773
Your birthday is in 15 minutes.

413
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:43,032
Listen.

414
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,994
Don't tell anyone about this.

415
00:29:47,328 --> 00:29:49,663
Or I'll be in deep trouble.

416
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,041
Here you go.

417
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:53,417
Happy birthday!

418
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,297
Call your mother and wish her.

419
00:29:58,714 --> 00:29:59,798
Quick!

420
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:01,717
And...

421
00:30:02,927 --> 00:30:05,971
please talk softly.

422
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,324
Mom!

423
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:26,951
Mom, it's me!

424
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,828
Happy birthday, Mom!

425
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,296
Allah hafiz, Mom.

426
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,258
Will you be back before
my holidays begin?

427
00:31:24,675 --> 00:31:25,843
Definitely.

428
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,720
Don't lie to me, Dad.

429
00:31:27,803 --> 00:31:29,847
I said I'll be back by then.

430
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,516
JK, please tell me the truth.

431
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,560
He's telling you the truth.

432
00:31:34,643 --> 00:31:37,563
He's going for a training
workshop to Srinagar.

433
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,273
You don't have to
worry about anything.

434
00:31:40,065 --> 00:31:42,318
Dad, please don't go!

435
00:31:42,401 --> 00:31:44,153
I'll call you every day.

436
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:45,404
Okay?

437
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,115
And don't trouble your mom.

438
00:31:48,699 --> 00:31:50,826
Okay? Promise?

439
00:31:51,035 --> 00:31:52,786
You two are fighting, aren't you?

440
00:31:53,370 --> 00:31:54,955
It's obvious, I'm not a kid.

441
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,290
Really?

442
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,251
You're a grown-up, aren't you?

443
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:02,087
Sri is going to Srinagar!

444
00:32:02,338 --> 00:32:03,922
"Sri! Srinagar!"
Get it?

445
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:09,219
You've also begun lying to me?

446
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:14,975
Nobody can lie to you
and your husband!

447
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:17,478
Actually...

448
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,272
there's an enquiry going on against him.

449
00:32:21,190 --> 00:32:23,192
So it's kind of a punishment.

450
00:32:24,777 --> 00:32:25,903
But don't worry.

451
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:29,198
Sri is our boss' favorite.

452
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,825
He won't let him stay there for long.

453
00:32:31,992 --> 00:32:33,952
I hope it's not a mission or something.

454
00:32:34,036 --> 00:32:35,245
Oh, God...

455
00:32:35,412 --> 00:32:37,164
There is no mission, Suchi!

456
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:39,583
Don't worry.
Everything's fine.

457
00:32:40,376 --> 00:32:41,752
How much longer, Sri?

458
00:32:41,835 --> 00:32:43,420
Don't be glued to your phone.

459
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:46,423
-Take care of him--
-Help him with his homework.

460
00:32:46,507 --> 00:32:48,717
Put him to sleep on time.
I know all that, okay?

461
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:51,011
Now will you answer my question, please?

462
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:53,847
-What?
-Is everything fine between you and Mom?

463
00:32:53,931 --> 00:32:55,265
-You two cool?
-What do you mean?

464
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:56,392
Shut up!

465
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,143
Go get a glass of water.

466
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,603
Go!

467
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:03,023
Just focus on playing
the flute and the harmonica.

468
00:33:03,107 --> 00:33:05,275
Got it? You need to master them.

469
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,277
We're spending a lot of money.

470
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:09,780
Dad, remember how
you thrashed that man?

471
00:33:09,863 --> 00:33:11,699
Didn't I tell you to keep your mouth shut?

472
00:33:11,782 --> 00:33:13,659
Yes, but even I want
to learn how to fight!

473
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,036
Why do you want to learn that?

474
00:33:16,995 --> 00:33:19,707
You haven't even learned to touch
your elders' feet for blessings!

475
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,543
When was the last time
you touched my feet?

476
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:24,128
Do it.

477
00:33:24,294 --> 00:33:25,295
Go on.

478
00:33:26,171 --> 00:33:27,172
May you always be happy.

479
00:33:28,257 --> 00:33:30,008
Suchi, please!

480
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,349
Bye.

481
00:33:38,642 --> 00:33:41,770
You're not doing this to
get back at me, are you?

482
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:44,356
No. I am just...

483
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,150
following the
department's orders.

484
00:33:46,233 --> 00:33:48,277
I know you won't get the time but...

485
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,779
call me at least once a
day and tell me you're okay.

486
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:52,489
Okay, bye.

487
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:08,547
I'd have taken a taxi.
Why did you come?

488
00:34:08,839 --> 00:34:10,883
Don't dick around with me.

489
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:13,135
The cold war's between you and Suchi.

490
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,344
Not between us.

491
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,513
-Move it!
-"Move it!"

492
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,104
Mom!

493
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:29,109
Is everything okay
between you and Dad?

494
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:31,320
Yes. Why?

495
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,238
I just felt...

496
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,574
-What?
-I don't know.

497
00:34:35,657 --> 00:34:37,034
I am sad.

498
00:34:39,661 --> 00:34:41,038
What is it, darling?

499
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:47,002
Don't worry, Dad will be back soon.

500
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,128
Okay?

501
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:49,671
I hope so.

502
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:51,548
Mom...

503
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:54,426
I don't feel like going to school.

504
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:56,220
So don't go.

505
00:34:56,386 --> 00:34:58,347
You can grow up to be a housemaid.

506
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:02,267
I'll tell our maid to train you.

507
00:35:02,351 --> 00:35:04,311
I'll also give you an internship at home.

508
00:35:06,104 --> 00:35:07,105
Very funny!

509
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:12,277
-I screwed up again.
-What?

510
00:35:12,361 --> 00:35:13,654
You mean, once again?

511
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,449
-Sorry, I meant...
-No.

512
00:35:18,951 --> 00:35:20,911
I took it too far this time.

513
00:35:20,994 --> 00:35:22,037
Listen, man.

514
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,498
Don't worry about Suchi.

515
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,291
She'll calm down.

516
00:35:26,375 --> 00:35:28,126
I've known you two for fifteen years.

517
00:35:28,210 --> 00:35:29,378
Nothing will change.

518
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,296
One more thing.

519
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,841
Don't stroll around
all alone in Srinagar.

520
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:36,927
Always carry your gun.

521
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,596
When in doubt...

522
00:35:39,847 --> 00:35:41,014
shoot first.

523
00:35:41,765 --> 00:35:43,225
Who's your CO there?

524
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:44,393
Guess.

525
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:46,728
Come on, tell me.

526
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,276
Saloni.

527
00:35:53,694 --> 00:35:55,070
Oh, fuck!

528
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:56,905
-You think it's funny?
-Shit!

529
00:35:57,197 --> 00:36:00,868
Why do such things
happen only with you?

530
00:36:03,579 --> 00:36:05,873
This is fucking ridiculous!
Saloni!

531
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:07,958
And that too in the middle of this mess!

532
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,884
As-salaam alaikum, General. 
 I have good news.

533
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:17,801
Wa alaykumu as-salam.

534
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,845
Our mujahid will be 
 discharged from the hospital

535
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,054
in a couple of days.

536
00:36:21,138 --> 00:36:23,765
I've asked the sleeper cell to 
 be on standby for the operation.

537
00:36:23,849 --> 00:36:24,892
Good.

538
00:36:25,559 --> 00:36:29,354
We need to get Zulfiqar back on
track as soon as possible

539
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:32,983
We cannot waste any more time!

540
00:36:33,066 --> 00:36:35,027
Is our second fighter in place?

541
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,278
Yes, sir.

542
00:36:36,403 --> 00:36:39,615
He got his orders
and has left for Kashmir.

543
00:36:39,698 --> 00:36:40,741
Remember...

544
00:36:40,866 --> 00:36:43,869
this time, there should be no mistakes.

545
00:36:44,077 --> 00:36:45,162
Sir.

546
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,206
Khuda hafiz.

547
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:04,222
Hello, sir.

548
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,266
Sorry, I just saw your message.

549
00:37:06,350 --> 00:37:08,226
-Are you there yet?
-Just landed, sir.

550
00:37:08,352 --> 00:37:10,562
I've sent you to
Srinagar for a reason.

551
00:37:10,646 --> 00:37:12,272
I'm not that stupid, sir.

552
00:37:12,356 --> 00:37:14,608
I've been working with
you for years now.

553
00:37:15,192 --> 00:37:16,860
I was awaiting your orders.

554
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:18,820
We've got information from RAW

555
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:23,367
that a key asset of Mission Zulfiqar
has arrived in Kashmir.

556
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,954
I want you to dig deeper into this.

557
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:29,706
Be careful, it's Kashmir.

558
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:32,960
Things might blow out of proportion.

559
00:37:33,043 --> 00:37:35,170
Thank you, sir.
I'll keep that in mind.

560
00:37:35,379 --> 00:37:38,090
Okay, sir.
They're here to receive me.

561
00:37:38,173 --> 00:37:40,258
Okay. Take care.

562
00:37:40,342 --> 00:37:41,593
Thank you, sir.

563
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:49,911
-How are things here nowadays?
-Can't you see?

564
00:38:49,995 --> 00:38:52,581
It feels like a free bird has been caged.

565
00:38:53,749 --> 00:38:57,294
These fuckers call Kashmir
the "crown of India."

566
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:02,883
But they treat us like shit.

567
00:39:04,092 --> 00:39:06,386
If they had as much concern
for the Kashmiri people

568
00:39:06,595 --> 00:39:09,222
as they have for Kashmir,
things would be different.

569
00:39:09,556 --> 00:39:10,849
That's the dilemma.

570
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:12,976
But everything is going to change now.

571
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,478
Inshallah!

572
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,813
How are things here nowadays?

573
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:20,025
All good!
We call the shots here.

574
00:39:20,275 --> 00:39:22,819
I heard the number of tourists
have increased.

575
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:27,282
I can see the tourists...

576
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:29,367
in uniform.

577
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,248
When do I meet Basharat?

578
00:39:35,582 --> 00:39:38,001
-I don't know.
-So what do I do?

579
00:39:40,003 --> 00:39:41,838
Just lie low and wait.

580
00:39:42,089 --> 00:39:44,007
They will let you know later.

581
00:39:47,344 --> 00:39:51,181
"If there is ever heaven on earth...

582
00:39:52,974 --> 00:39:56,561
it is here, it is here."

583
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,177
-What's wrong?
-I want to see my brother.

584
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,848
Asif?

585
00:40:35,183 --> 00:40:38,645
But you don't have
access to that room.

586
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:43,191
I need to see him, Mary.
I need to see my brother.

587
00:40:43,275 --> 00:40:45,360
But how will you go in there?

588
00:41:03,503 --> 00:41:05,213
What are you doing?

589
00:41:06,631 --> 00:41:07,757
Mary...

590
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:09,759
I have to see him.

591
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,386
Moosa...

592
00:41:14,389 --> 00:41:15,557
Moosa...

593
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,311
My supervisors will question me.
I'll lose my job.

594
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,273
Mary...

595
00:41:24,191 --> 00:41:25,817
I won't put you in trouble.

596
00:41:26,193 --> 00:41:27,402
Trust me.

597
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:35,911
I'll be right back.

598
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:54,341
Did you squeal to the infidels?

599
00:43:55,467 --> 00:43:57,802
No, Asif Bhai. 
I didn't.

600
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:09,981
What are you doing here?

601
00:44:47,852 --> 00:44:50,021
Nothing personal, Asif Bhai.

602
00:44:53,775 --> 00:44:55,360
Potassium.

603
00:44:56,569 --> 00:44:58,488
I injected it into your bloodstream.

604
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,617
Close your eyes.

605
00:45:04,619 --> 00:45:06,371
You'll die in peace.

606
00:45:08,665 --> 00:45:12,335
I don't want you to squeal
to the infidels...

607
00:45:13,545 --> 00:45:15,213
about Zulfiqar.

608
00:45:36,776 --> 00:45:38,528
Allah hafiz, brother.
