1
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,188
He'll be here for the next few days.

2
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,982
They call him Al Qatil.

3
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,986
He's just like the ISIS. Brutal.

4
00:00:27,445 --> 00:00:29,113
He's the best.

5
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,825
Killing infidels is his only goal.

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:36,704
He's been making chemical
bombs for ISIS.

7
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:40,124
I don't think...

8
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:43,210
ISIS will ever let go
of a capable person like him.

9
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,462
Never.

10
00:00:45,129 --> 00:00:48,132
That's why we need to
get him out of here.

11
00:00:48,424 --> 00:00:51,469
And then, with the help of your men...

12
00:00:51,635 --> 00:00:53,262
he can cross into India.

13
00:00:53,763 --> 00:00:54,847
That can be arranged.

14
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:58,642
Daesh is going to lose the war.

15
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:01,937
They cannot win,
no matter what they do.

16
00:01:02,438 --> 00:01:04,648
They can fight it out
for another year, at the most.

17
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:08,027
We cannot let them waste his talent.

18
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:10,613
Instead of him being shot or caught

19
00:01:10,696 --> 00:01:12,281
we could put him to good use.

20
00:01:26,629 --> 00:01:27,922
As-salaam alaikum.

21
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:51,487
What have the terrorists
reduced this nation to!

22
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,322
Even hell must be better.

23
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,949
And you take orders
from such people?

24
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:56,826
I only listen to His orders.

25
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,785
Do you?

26
00:01:57,868 --> 00:01:59,870
Or of those who pay you
in American dollars?

27
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:13,133
Faizan Bhai!

28
00:02:13,217 --> 00:02:15,803
-As-salaam alaikum 
 -Wa alaykumu as-salam.

29
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:24,854
Meet this gentleman.

30
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:28,148
This is my guardian and
a dear friend, Major Sameer.

31
00:02:28,232 --> 00:02:29,275
He works for the ISI

32
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,318
and has come from Pakistan
just to meet you.

33
00:02:31,402 --> 00:02:32,611
As-salaam alaikum, Sameer Bhai.

34
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,321
Wa alaykumu as-salam.

35
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:37,783
I've heard a lot about you.

36
00:02:38,075 --> 00:02:40,369
-Al Qatil, right?
-Sameer Bhai...

37
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:43,998
I don't label my work.

38
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:47,793
Isn't that Istanbul's Shia Masjid?

39
00:02:47,877 --> 00:02:50,462
-In 2016, around--
-270 people died.

40
00:02:50,546 --> 00:02:52,923
It was the biggest chemical attack
in ten years.

41
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:57,011
You used the nerve gas which
ISIS stole from Syria, right?

42
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,262
That too...

43
00:02:58,596 --> 00:02:59,555
with other things.

44
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,224
I customized the nerve agent

45
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,185
to maximize the damage.

46
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,979
If the blast had been bigger

47
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:08,981
buildings would
have been destroyed...

48
00:03:09,064 --> 00:03:10,024
with bodies scattered around.

49
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,901
It would have been a spectacle on TV.

50
00:03:11,984 --> 00:03:13,444
There should've
been more destruction.

51
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:15,112
Pardon me, Faizan Bhai.

52
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,156
But there was destruction.

53
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,825
270 dead bodies.

54
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,703
I don't work because
I want publicity on TV.

55
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,789
I wanted to kill the most
number of infidels.

56
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,250
Faizan Bhai!

57
00:03:28,334 --> 00:03:30,502
Please excuse us.

58
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,464
What?

59
00:03:46,769 --> 00:03:48,687
I have a mission for you.

60
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,314
A very special one.

61
00:03:51,148 --> 00:03:53,692
Mission Zulfiqar.

62
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:49,415
Saloni Bhatt!

63
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,626
-After so many years!
-Yup!

64
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,088
Nagaland.

65
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,717
Feels like... it was ages ago.

66
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:02,469
I never thought we'd meet again.

67
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,096
Neither did I.

68
00:05:05,723 --> 00:05:07,725
Now you're my CO.

69
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,186
-Does that bother you?
-What?

70
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:16,608
Why would it bother me?
It's so good to see you.

71
00:05:19,028 --> 00:05:20,696
You're still the same.

72
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:22,823
But you've gotten old.

73
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,828
So...

74
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:31,248
-how's your husb--
-My who?

75
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:32,791
Your...

76
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,961
husband... Husband.

77
00:05:36,086 --> 00:05:38,047
You don't even know his name.

78
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:39,590
Come on!

79
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:43,635
I don't chant his name all the time.

80
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,262
And we haven't been in touch.

81
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:47,765
So you are telling me that
I didn't keep in touch?

82
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:50,267
No. All I was saying is...

83
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,687
It's so good to see you

84
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:55,898
after all this time.

85
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:00,903
Come on, tell me.
What's his name?

86
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,280
What's the name of the fortunate soul

87
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:05,491
who got to marry you, Your Highness?

88
00:06:05,908 --> 00:06:07,618
I'm not telling you shit!

89
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:09,203
Follow me!

90
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,372
Of course!

91
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:14,541
That's what I've always done.

92
00:06:14,666 --> 00:06:16,001
So this is it.

93
00:06:17,753 --> 00:06:21,006
The headquarters is in Jammu.
This is a temporary office.

94
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:23,092
-You can take that desk.
-Okay.

95
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,178
And listen, Srikant.
You don't need to do anything.

96
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,764
Just try and stay out of the way!

97
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:31,850
Don't create a mess
like you did in Mumbai, please.

98
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:35,187
Sorry.

99
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:36,688
Maybe that was out of line.

100
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,023
It was.

101
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:39,733
Okay, settle down.

102
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,901
Thank you.

103
00:06:41,235 --> 00:06:42,277
Saloni.

104
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:44,988
I wanted to ask you something.

105
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,952
Have you heard about Mission Zulfiqar?

106
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,787
Zulfiqar?

107
00:06:52,704 --> 00:06:53,705
No.

108
00:06:53,997 --> 00:06:55,791
There's a young man...

109
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,460
who has just arrived in Kashmir.

110
00:06:58,544 --> 00:07:02,172
No one knows how he looks
or where he's staying.

111
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:04,508
But we do know that

112
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:07,136
he's an important asset
for this mission.

113
00:07:07,302 --> 00:07:08,137
Oh.

114
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:10,264
Is that why you are here?

115
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,141
So this is not a
punishment posting?

116
00:07:12,224 --> 00:07:14,601
No, it is a punishment posting.

117
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:17,604
But they want me
on this as well.

118
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,690
Has Kulkarni sent you?

119
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:26,613
Okay, let me ask military
intelligence if they know anything.

120
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,115
-I'll get back to you.
-Thank you.

121
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:29,741
-Okay.
-Can we have lunch together?

122
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,118
Not a chance.

123
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:37,916
Doctor, is it possible

124
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,003
-that he tried to kill himself?
-I don't think so.

125
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:43,922
The cause of his death
is cardiac arrest.

126
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,340
But...

127
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:47,009
it looks a bit fishy.

128
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:48,552
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

129
00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:50,971
he did have
internal injuries.

130
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:52,347
But he was recovering quite well.

131
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:54,016
His GCS score was eleven.

132
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:56,101
-And you mean eleven was good?
-Yes.

133
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,811
When he came in,
his score was five.

134
00:07:57,895 --> 00:07:59,771
So, eleven was good.

135
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,440
-Show me the sheet.
-Yeah.

136
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:05,360
According to the log sheet,
he was quite stable.

137
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:08,113
Did you guys observe anything
unusual in his cardio activity?

138
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,449
No, sir. The patient
died due to arrhythmia.

139
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,202
But we're unable to
diagnose what caused it.

140
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,997
Did you notice anything
strange yesterday?

141
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,957
No, sir. All vitals were good.

142
00:08:19,082 --> 00:08:20,334
And you?

143
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:22,836
What's your name?

144
00:08:22,961 --> 00:08:25,214
-Mary.
-Did you notice anything?

145
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,715
No, sir.

146
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:30,385
Dr. Patel, all those who had
access to the secure wing

147
00:08:30,469 --> 00:08:33,513
cannot leave the city while
the investigation is on.

148
00:08:33,597 --> 00:08:34,640
Sure.

149
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:39,478
Think again, Talpade.

150
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,146
Are you sure nothing's fishy?

151
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:43,857
I don't know how or when they did it.

152
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,901
Someone would have seen something, right?

153
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,069
But everything is clean here.

154
00:08:47,152 --> 00:08:48,862
That's why I have my doubts.

155
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,031
Our biggest lead on Zulfiqar...

156
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,991
comes out of a coma and dies.

157
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:54,868
And nobody knows how!

158
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:57,412
Forward his medical report to me.

159
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:58,705
I'll do that.

160
00:08:59,039 --> 00:08:59,957
Since Asif's dead,

161
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,000
Sharma is planning to
reduce the security here.

162
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,253
Has Sharma fucking lost it?

163
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,422
-Listen, tell Pasha-- 
-Pasha has been suspended.

164
00:09:08,382 --> 00:09:10,759
You're not on the case anymore. 
 I am doing what I can.

165
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:12,344
And Asif was not our friend.

166
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,679
He was a wanted terrorist.

167
00:09:13,762 --> 00:09:15,931
One of the Zulfiqar bastards has died.

168
00:09:16,014 --> 00:09:17,808
This is good for us, Tiwari.

169
00:09:18,684 --> 00:09:20,435
I don't know, man.

170
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,562
-What do you mean?
-Talpade, I'm telling you

171
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,398
this just doesn't seem right.

172
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:27,567
Alright. Until a permanent 
 solution is found

173
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:29,861
I'll put our juniors
around the hospital.

174
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:32,281
-Is that good enough?
 -Talpade, do one thing.

175
00:09:32,406 --> 00:09:34,241
Make arrangements to move Moosa to jail.

176
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:35,784
-Okay.
 -He'll be safer there.

177
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,452
I'll do it.

178
00:09:49,923 --> 00:09:52,342
ATS has withdrawn
almost all security.

179
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,094
But Moosa is still here.

180
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:56,138
This place can't be left unguarded.

181
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:57,973
How many ATS guys do we have now?

182
00:09:58,056 --> 00:09:59,182
Only two.

183
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,184
But we can't count on them.

184
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,353
You guys stay here and be alert.

185
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:05,147
If need be, take turns.

186
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,065
As long as that fucking Moosa is here

187
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,984
we're responsible for his safety.

188
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,695
I am going to get
Moosa's judicial custody.

189
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,031
I want updates every half an hour.

190
00:10:14,197 --> 00:10:15,866
Got it? I'll be back.

191
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,297
-Hi, Suchi.
-Hi.

192
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,257
Welcome!

193
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,926
I thought you called me to your office.

194
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,179
We'll get an office
when we have the funds.

195
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:39,765
Until then, this café is our office.

196
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:42,642
-Your entire team is here?
-It's okay!

197
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:44,811
Consider this your own office, okay?

198
00:10:45,062 --> 00:10:46,104
Come.

199
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:49,816
Nikhil? Suchitra.

200
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,610
-Oh, hi. Welcome.
-Hi.

201
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,112
-I'll see you guys later.
-Oh, sure.

202
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:59,534
Guys? She's Suchitra

203
00:10:59,618 --> 00:11:01,995
and she's the VP Marketing
for our company.

204
00:11:03,789 --> 00:11:05,290
-Say hi.
-Hello.

205
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:07,709
-Hi.
-Come, sit.

206
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,801
Why did you tell
everyone I'm a VP?

207
00:11:15,884 --> 00:11:17,594
Because you are.

208
00:11:17,844 --> 00:11:20,055
Everybody's a VP in
this company, so chill.

209
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:21,640
Okay, listen.

210
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,475
I was working on
the presentation

211
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,227
and I've noted
down a few points.

212
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:27,729
"Noted down" as in?
On paper?

213
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,941
Dhriti's always fighting
for the laptop, that's why.

214
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,151
Do you need a laptop?
Take mine.

215
00:11:33,318 --> 00:11:34,403
But...

216
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:41,410
What would you like to have, ma'am?

217
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:47,416
-Can I order in some time?
-Sure.

218
00:11:52,546 --> 00:11:54,631
Yeah. Here we go.

219
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,133
You're sure, right?

220
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:58,301
Yeah, it's cool.
I'll order another one.

221
00:12:01,972 --> 00:12:03,515
-Thank you for the laptop.
-Welcome.

222
00:12:03,598 --> 00:12:05,851
Now if you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do.

223
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,028
Are you sure he's hiding there?

224
00:12:17,404 --> 00:12:18,697
Intel's good, sir.

225
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,699
-Any movement?
-Negative, sir.

226
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:23,368
Copy. Wait for me till I get there.

227
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:24,870
-ETA seven minutes.
 -Sir.

228
00:12:25,328 --> 00:12:27,706
Are you sure this is
connected to Zulfiqar?

229
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,791
Major Vikram thinks so.

230
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,043
Once we catch them,
we'll know for sure.

231
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,560
You guys stay here.
I'll be back in a bit.

232
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:49,853
Firdaus.

233
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,859
Checking the parameter.

234
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:01,239
Unit One, ready to engage.

235
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:03,408
-Anything?
-No, sir.

236
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:05,410
Nothing since we came here.

237
00:13:05,952 --> 00:13:07,037
Let's go.

238
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,897
First floor clear, sir.

239
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:35,190
Second floor clear, sir.

240
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,608
He's gone.

241
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:40,862
Check all the rooms.

242
00:13:46,868 --> 00:13:47,911
Cigarette?

243
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:49,412
I have quit.

244
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,675
So you've changed after all.

245
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:03,385
A lot has changed.

246
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:05,971
You just know some
old version of me.

247
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:07,681
Really?

248
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:11,893
Tell me more about
this new version.

249
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,731
Why?

250
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:19,317
Why now?

251
00:14:22,445 --> 00:14:24,948
Listen, Saloni...

252
00:14:27,117 --> 00:14:29,536
I'm sorry, sorry for everything.

253
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:37,294
Won't you apologize as well?

254
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,628
Why should I?

255
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,922
-It was your fault.
-Oh, really?

256
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,549
And you're not to be blamed?

257
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:45,510
Yes. It was all your fault.

258
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,726
So this is what you have
been telling yourself?

259
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:56,646
You were equally responsible.

260
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,440
Actually more!

261
00:14:58,523 --> 00:14:59,899
You actually believe

262
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:02,235
-that I was equally responsible?
-Absolutely!

263
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:05,405
You are unbelievable!

264
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,699
And I'm such a fool

265
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:10,076
to have felt guilty all this time!

266
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:14,122
Such a wastage of guilt!

267
00:15:20,378 --> 00:15:21,504
What?

268
00:15:24,132 --> 00:15:25,258
What?

269
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,385
If we had married

270
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,929
we would've killed each other.

271
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,724
And we'd have continued fighting
in the afterlife.

272
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,726
"It was your fault!"
"No, it was yours!"

273
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:36,436
Exactly!

274
00:15:44,277 --> 00:15:45,987
Nobody there.
But the good news is

275
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:47,822
that this was definitely a safe house.

276
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,450
And if my guess is right,
Basharat was here too.

277
00:15:50,575 --> 00:15:52,786
Now it won't take long to trace him.

278
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:57,540
Basharat knows everything
that happens in Kashmir.

279
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,586
He was operating out of POK for years.

280
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:03,254
He's involved in every infiltration

281
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,756
that takes place across the border.

282
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,092
He's got a network of local support.

283
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:10,178
And now, he's active on
this side of the border.

284
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:13,348
If your asset is planning
anything in Kashmir

285
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,058
he'll definitely meet Basharat.

286
00:16:15,225 --> 00:16:16,685
I'm pretty confident about that.

287
00:16:22,232 --> 00:16:23,358
-Mom!
-Mom!

288
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:24,401
Watch it!

289
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:26,027
Both of you, shut up!

290
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,404
I am the one driving!

291
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:29,948
Your little Lilliput leg can't
even reach the accelerator!

292
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:31,491
So stop teaching me!

293
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:32,784
She called you a Lilliputian.

294
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,786
-That was for you, dumbass.
-Shut up!

295
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:37,539
Let me drive peacefully, please!

296
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,166
I don't know why
I stopped driving.

297
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:44,129
Listen, after the music class,
please wait there for me.

298
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:45,380
I will pick you up, okay?

299
00:16:45,463 --> 00:16:47,549
-Can we go somewhere else, please?
-Yes, Mom!

300
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:48,466
-No!
-Please!

301
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:50,385
Do you know how much
your classes cost?

302
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:51,720
Yeah, we know!

303
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:54,222
Suchi, since when did
you become so boring?

304
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:55,598
-I swear!
-What?

305
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:58,309
Atharv, what did you just say?

306
00:16:58,601 --> 00:17:02,063
-And why are you laughing?
-Mom, please!

307
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:08,278
-Shall we go to the mall?
-Yes!

308
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:16,745
People will think you starve at home.

309
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,997
You said we could
order anything, right?

310
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:20,206
And now you're lecturing us?

311
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:21,958
Yeah, but this way too much!

312
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,419
Go easy!

313
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:26,504
Look at this.
Very pretty, right?

314
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:28,339
No?

315
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:29,924
Too bright.

316
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,969
Try this on, please.

317
00:17:33,887 --> 00:17:35,263
I don't wear such clothes.

318
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:36,931
Mom!

319
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,433
Trust me, I know my shit.

320
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,434
What kind of language--

321
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,519
-Mom, please!
-How can you talk like that?

322
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,694
Not allowed.

323
00:17:57,285 --> 00:17:59,162
Wow! Sexy!

324
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:02,040
Yeah? Too much, right?

325
00:18:02,123 --> 00:18:04,876
You've not grown old yet.
So, chill.

326
00:18:13,927 --> 00:18:15,970
-Go, answer it.
-You do it!

327
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:19,224
You always do this!

328
00:18:23,311 --> 00:18:24,145
Hello.

329
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:25,980
What's happening, you little brat?

330
00:18:26,064 --> 00:18:29,442
Dad, I've decided that I'll learn
to play the ukulele.

331
00:18:29,526 --> 00:18:31,027
-But why?
 -What do you mean?

332
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,029
I've already learned all 
 the other instruments.

333
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:34,823
Okay, tell me how was school?

334
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,784
Dad, guess what!
We went out today.

335
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:41,162
Mom took us to the mall. 
 It was so much fun.

336
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:44,249
But then Mom and Dhriti
started shopping.

337
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:45,959
That was the end of the fun part.

338
00:18:46,918 --> 00:18:49,295
Please! Mom did not
let me buy anything.

339
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:51,422
But she bought six 
 new tops for herself.

340
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:54,092
Wow! You guys are having fun.

341
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,470
Yeah, Mom gave us a treat
for her new job.

342
00:18:58,096 --> 00:18:59,264
Really?

343
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:02,767
-What's she doing?
 -I don't know.

344
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,937
She's always glued to her laptop.

345
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,064
What the...
You got a MacBook!

346
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,440
Are you seriously kidding me?

347
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:12,235
Dad, Mom bought a brand-new Apple.

348
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:13,278
Apple?

349
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,071
Do you even know how to use this?

350
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,282
-Wow!
-This is so unfair!

351
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,868
-I use that piece of junk... 
-Hello?

352
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,078
-Mom! Just let me see it.
 -Hello?

353
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,329
-Hello? 
-Why?

354
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,247
Dhriti!

355
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,639
Fuck!

356
00:21:48,558 --> 00:21:49,767
Oh, fuck!

357
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,440
Give me two glasses of tea.

358
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,321
Why is it not hot?

359
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:03,906
I just made it.

360
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:09,245
-Yes?
-Talpade, where's Pasha?

361
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,496
He's with me. Why?

362
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,498
Take him along and
go to the hospital.

363
00:22:12,582 --> 00:22:13,750
What's the matter?

364
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,627
Do you know about Al Qatil?

365
00:22:16,711 --> 00:22:19,088
ISIS.
The executioner of Raqqa.

366
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:21,340
He's number six on the FBI list.

367
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:23,051
So, yes, I know him. Go on.

368
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:24,886
This guy, Moosa...

369
00:22:25,595 --> 00:22:27,722
Moosa is Al Qatil.
That fucker!

370
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,600
-What are you saying!
 -He fucking fooled us all!

371
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:32,351
We were too busy focusing on Asif!

372
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:34,062
Moosa turned out to be Al Qatil!

373
00:22:34,228 --> 00:22:37,315
Call ATS and ask them 
 to increase security.

374
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:40,026
And get moving, immediately!

375
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,237
We need to get to the hospital.
Let's go!

376
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:53,331
Sir, we need security in
the hospital immediately!

377
00:22:53,414 --> 00:22:56,542
Because Srikant thinks
that Moosa is Al Qatil?

378
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:59,003
I think he's right.

379
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:00,588
What if he's wrong?

380
00:23:00,671 --> 00:23:02,673
Sir, all I'm asking for
is an increase in security.

381
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:06,135
Only till we move Moosa to jail.
Please, sir.

382
00:23:06,219 --> 00:23:08,262
Fine. I'll speak to the ATS chief

383
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,764
and assign a unit to the hospital.

384
00:23:09,847 --> 00:23:11,933
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

385
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:18,189
The number you are trying to call--

386
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:21,192
There's no network, is there?

387
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,071
Okay, I'm going to the café.

388
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:26,072
Do you need something?

389
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,198
Jayesh?

390
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:34,622
Okay, I'm also going for a smoke.

391
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:36,582
You want to come along?

392
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,042
I'm good.

393
00:23:40,128 --> 00:23:41,170
Come in.

394
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,550
-Sir, you wanted to see me?
-Yes, Mary. Come, sit.

395
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:58,646
Mary...

396
00:23:59,188 --> 00:24:00,565
I thought I should talk to you,

397
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,400
before speaking to security.

398
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:04,527
What happened, sir?

399
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:08,781
Asif's case was not
assigned to you, right?

400
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:12,702
Then what were you doing
in his room last night?

401
00:24:16,038 --> 00:24:17,081
Sir...

402
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:20,710
Actually... I didn't...

403
00:24:22,837 --> 00:24:27,466
Your access card was the
last to be swiped...

404
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,261
right before he died.

405
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:45,151
Roll down your window.

406
00:24:47,153 --> 00:24:48,237
Okay, go ahead.

407
00:24:49,071 --> 00:24:50,281
Let them through.

408
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,963
Check all your stuff.

409
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,175
I don't want any mistakes.

410
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,761
Bilal Bhai, can I ask you something?

411
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:15,139
Will the four of us be enough
for this assignment?

412
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,683
Get this straight

413
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:22,021
never teach Daddy how to fuck!

414
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:24,398
Why are you getting mad at me?

415
00:25:26,275 --> 00:25:29,946
Are we really here to fetch Al Qatil?

416
00:25:30,905 --> 00:25:33,574
Will you stop talking?
Just drive the fucking car!

417
00:25:40,414 --> 00:25:42,458
-Are you all ready?
-Yes, bhai!

418
00:25:43,668 --> 00:25:46,087
Keep the car ready. Got it?

419
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,640
We're here.

420
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:17,660
How many?

421
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,997
Two in the control room,
and the rest, upstairs.

422
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,749
Let's go.

423
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:11,797
Go upstairs.

424
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,273
Zoya.

425
00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:30,358
Yes, Milind?

426
00:27:30,441 --> 00:27:32,151
Can you get me a 
 coffee too, please?

427
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,029
I knew you would ask.
I already have one.

428
00:27:56,175 --> 00:27:57,885
Jayesh, you're here?

429
00:27:58,886 --> 00:28:01,055
Yes, I had to make a call.

430
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,392
Have you pumped enough
smoke into your lungs?

431
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,603
It's a hospital.
Smoking's not allowed.

432
00:28:07,812 --> 00:28:10,147
Okay. Well, you'll live longer.

433
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,565
I'll see you inside.

434
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,682
Jayesh, is everything okay?

435
00:28:44,765 --> 00:28:47,059
-Yes, sir. What happened?
 -Stay alert.

436
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:48,936
Tell the others to be alert as well.

437
00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,771
I've requested extra security from ATS.

438
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,566
They're on their way. 
 And secure all the exits.

439
00:28:53,649 --> 00:28:55,734
-But what happened, sir?
 -There's no confirmation

440
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,945
but Srikant thinks something's up.

441
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,655
Pasha and I are almost there.

442
00:28:59,738 --> 00:29:01,866
Warn the guards too, and...

443
00:29:02,533 --> 00:29:03,951
just be safe.

444
00:31:58,125 --> 00:31:59,293
Al Qatil.

445
00:32:00,377 --> 00:32:01,670
How are you, Bilal?

446
00:32:13,974 --> 00:32:14,850
Fuck!

447
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:16,143
Shit!

448
00:32:16,435 --> 00:32:19,063
Milind, red alert.
We're under attack.

449
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:20,898
We need backup.
Do you copy?

450
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,441
Fuck!

451
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:24,360
-I am coming there! 
-Shit! Shit!

452
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,540
Shit!
We're under attack!

453
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:44,380
Zoya!

454
00:32:47,966 --> 00:32:50,302
-Moosa's escaping.
-Fuck!

455
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,054
Milind, check for backup.

456
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,411
Give me the bag.

457
00:33:58,162 --> 00:33:59,288
Hurry up.

458
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,984
Drive! Let's go!

459
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:30,194
Fuck!

460
00:34:37,618 --> 00:34:40,287
The black car!
Catch the black car!

461
00:34:42,331 --> 00:34:43,874
Go! Go!

462
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,588
-Fuck!
-They won't be able to get too far.

463
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,923
They will get caught.

464
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,759
-Where's Jayesh?
-Nowhere to be found.

465
00:34:53,842 --> 00:34:55,385
He's not even answering his phone.

466
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,055
-Go in and look for him.
-Yes.

467
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,647
Let's check the number of casualties.

468
00:35:07,189 --> 00:35:10,025
Shit! What a mess!

469
00:35:14,655 --> 00:35:15,697
Yes?

470
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:17,783
What?

471
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:19,535
What do you mean?

472
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,829
If not in the van, where are they?

473
00:35:24,248 --> 00:35:25,499
Pasha!

474
00:35:26,333 --> 00:35:28,001
They are still inside the hospital.

475
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:29,294
What?

476
00:35:46,228 --> 00:35:47,563
Pasha!

477
00:35:52,693 --> 00:35:54,778
Pasha!

478
00:35:58,490 --> 00:35:59,908
I think we lost him.

479
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:03,036
Fuck!

480
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:07,624
Moosa!

481
00:36:10,085 --> 00:36:11,628
We didn't get Moosa, did we?

482
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,939
When I step out...

483
00:36:32,149 --> 00:36:33,400
will you scream for help?

484
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:37,946
Are you sure?

485
00:36:51,168 --> 00:36:52,836
Please...

486
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:55,005
don't hurt me.

487
00:37:01,094 --> 00:37:02,679
How can I hurt you?

488
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:07,392
You're my Mary.

489
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,689
How can I...
