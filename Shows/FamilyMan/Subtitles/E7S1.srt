1
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:19,645
In a brazen attack on Fortune Hospital 
 in Mumbai, last night,

2
00:00:19,937 --> 00:00:21,689
terrorists went on a shooting spree

3
00:00:21,772 --> 00:00:24,275
and killed multiple people, 
 that include hospital staff

4
00:00:24,316 --> 00:00:26,193
patients and...

5
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,070
Security agencies are yet to release

6
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:30,281
the exact number 
 of casualties.

7
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:32,324
A lot of casualties 
 have been reported.

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:34,034
It's quite shocking actually.

9
00:00:34,118 --> 00:00:36,495
According to our sources at least 
 18 people have died

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:38,914
including the four assailants 
 at the Fortune Hospital massacre.

11
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,332
What is the ATS doing?

12
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,667
What is the NIA doing?

13
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:43,377
What are we doing 
 right now to ensure

14
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,920
that such things and such incidents

15
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:46,338
do not happen in my city again?

16
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,174
I request our honorable leader,

17
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,259
the Prime Minister of India

18
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:54,096
to order an immediate, decisive 
 and fitting surgical strike

19
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,723
upon our enemies again.

20
00:00:55,806 --> 00:00:58,934
And make it clear, once and 
 for all that new India

21
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,603
will not take it lying down.

22
00:01:32,843 --> 00:01:33,886
Hello.

23
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:34,970
Hello.

24
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,097
Is this Mohammad's shop?

25
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,390
Yes, tell me.

26
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,726
May I speak to Meherunnisa?

27
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:42,269
Meherunnisa?

28
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,396
Who's calling?

29
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:48,067
I...
I am a relative.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,693
Okay.

31
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:51,654
The landlord asked
her to vacate a year ago

32
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,906
because she couldn't pay rent.

33
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:58,661
I think... she left after that.

34
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:01,372
Do you know where she went?

35
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:03,749
No, I haven't heard
from her ever since.

36
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,003
Any information at all?
Please, sir.

37
00:02:08,128 --> 00:02:11,090
Well, she always said

38
00:02:11,173 --> 00:02:14,134
that her son would get 
 her out of the village.

39
00:02:14,343 --> 00:02:15,386
Maybe that's what happened.

40
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,680
Maybe she's in the Gulf, with her son.

41
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,329
As-salaam alaikum, brother!

42
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,789
How's everything?

43
00:03:27,249 --> 00:03:28,626
Have you eaten yet?

44
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,628
What do I have to do next?

45
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:32,171
Is Basharat going to meet me?

46
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:34,715
I have no idea
about that, brother.

47
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:37,885
-So are you here for a stroll?
-I am here to check on you.

48
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:41,597
We wanted to ensure that you're fine.

49
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,391
"We"?

50
00:03:45,684 --> 00:03:48,812
-Who is "we"?
-Don't ask questions.

51
00:03:49,188 --> 00:03:51,774
Just do what you're told.
That's the order.

52
00:03:51,941 --> 00:03:53,192
Whose order?

53
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,278
I don't know who the fuck you are!

54
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,781
Or what the fuck
I'm doing in Kashmir!

55
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:01,200
Someone gives me
new instructions every day!

56
00:04:01,283 --> 00:04:03,869
Nobody knows what
the fuck is going on!

57
00:04:04,119 --> 00:04:05,663
Get out of here!

58
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:08,082
Hang on.
What are you doing?

59
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,625
Get the fuck out of here!

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,085
And whoever's giving you orders,

61
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,545
tell him to speak to me directly.

62
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:15,714
And if it's Faizan Bhai issuing the orders

63
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:17,549
tell him, I want to speak to him.

64
00:04:17,633 --> 00:04:19,093
I want to listen to his voice.

65
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,261
And I need all the
details of this mission.

66
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,639
What to do and when to do it.
Everything!

67
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:39,071
Saloni, I've worked
with many people...

68
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:43,325
but never met anyone like Pasha.

69
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,248
His duty was his only priority!

70
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:04,013
First, those three innocents
were killed, and now Pasha!

71
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:07,224
Come on, Srikant.

72
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,143
You can't blame
yourself for everything.

73
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,818
I can't just sit here and watch!

74
00:05:21,113 --> 00:05:21,947
Hello, sir.

75
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:22,990
Yes, Srikant.

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,409
-How are things there, sir?
 -Don't ask.

77
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,786
TASC is on the verge 
 of being shut down.

78
00:05:28,746 --> 00:05:31,081
Sir, I think we should
be on high alert.

79
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,710
Moosa has been sent
for a special purpose.

80
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,421
And he's also a chemical weapons expert.

81
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,590
I think they're 
 planning something big.

82
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:43,385
I've issued a red alert
across all cities in India.

83
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:46,764
Sir, I have information that
a few more are involved.

84
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,308
-There's a whole team in Kashmir--
-Srikant, let us handle this.

85
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:51,977
If I need you, I'll let you know.

86
00:05:52,061 --> 00:05:54,438
You need to stay
away from the field.

87
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,566
Take care, Srikant.

88
00:06:01,445 --> 00:06:03,280
Talpade, what the fuck 
 is happening there?

89
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:04,740
Goddammit!

90
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,201
It's just one problem after another.

91
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,286
TASC is going to face an inquiry.

92
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,789
-Any news on the hospital attack?
 -Nothing.

93
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,707
Seems like it was a new sleeper cell.

94
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:15,584
It wasn't even on our radar.

95
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:19,004
-Did you meet Pasha's family?
-I met his mother.

96
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:22,007
His father refused to see Pasha's corpse.

97
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:25,302
His mother wants him 
 buried in his hometown.

98
00:06:28,764 --> 00:06:29,932
Talpade...

99
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:32,559
what about Moosa's mother?

100
00:06:33,352 --> 00:06:34,394
What?

101
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:38,982
That bastard was talking
about meeting his mother.

102
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,777
Do you think he was telling us the truth?

103
00:06:42,361 --> 00:06:44,238
I don't think that bastard
even has a mother!

104
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,281
I don't know why

105
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,243
I think he was being
truthful about this.

106
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:50,452
I don't know.

107
00:06:50,536 --> 00:06:52,037
I can't understand what's going on!

108
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,163
Find out.

109
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,332
-Find out.
 -Okay.

110
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:16,937
Hello.

111
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,856
Hi. What happened?

112
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,567
I got her blood test done.
But nothing showed up.

113
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,443
I got it done again.

114
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,155
I don't know why I'm
getting worried now.

115
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:28,824
The fever won't go away.

116
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:30,242
Isn't your wife there?

117
00:07:30,993 --> 00:07:32,244
Is anybody there?

118
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,747
Nobody's here right now.

119
00:07:36,081 --> 00:07:37,749
I am all by myself, for a few days.

120
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:40,377
-Do you need any help?
-No, it's okay. It's fine.

121
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,712
I'll manage.

122
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:44,214
I just fed her some noodles.

123
00:07:44,339 --> 00:07:45,174
Arvind!

124
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,676
Your daughter's not well
and you fed her noodles?

125
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:49,011
Are you mad?

126
00:08:08,864 --> 00:08:11,283
-Hi.
-How come you're...

127
00:08:12,951 --> 00:08:14,620
I mean, come in.

128
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,372
Hi, Rhea!

129
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,833
I am Suchi.

130
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:25,839
Are you hungry?

131
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:27,799
Yes?

132
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,343
Would you like to have Rasam Rice?

133
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,387
Please! You'll get a lot of chips as well!

134
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:35,015
Okay? I'll make it in a jiffy.

135
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,563
Arvind, where's the coriander?

136
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:43,732
Here.

137
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:46,235
-Should I cut it for you?
-No, that's fine.

138
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:47,778
Where are the curry leaves?

139
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,198
-Curry leaves... here.
-Thanks.

140
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,450
And where's the garlic?

141
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,456
Here.

142
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,542
It's stale!

143
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:04,211
The maid chopped it yesterday!

144
00:09:04,294 --> 00:09:06,004
Then, give it to your maid.

145
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,215
Here is your chip...

146
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,634
topped with some Rasam Rice.

147
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,095
Come on, open your mouth.

148
00:09:15,055 --> 00:09:16,306
Very good!

149
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,393
When Dhriti was younger,
she was just like this.

150
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,520
And now she acts like she's my mum.

151
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:28,318
Why did I not think
about the chips?

152
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,153
I mean, it's super tasty!

153
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,656
And thanks for coming.

154
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:37,619
Thank you.

155
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:41,581
By the way, do you feel like working?

156
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,877
Yeah, sure. With beer?

157
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,132
We shouldn't emphasize the AI part.

158
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,383
I mean, AI is good

159
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:53,927
but eventually,
it's artificial intelligence. So...

160
00:09:54,052 --> 00:09:57,055
So, yeah, it can never
replace human intelligence.

161
00:09:57,139 --> 00:09:58,724
-Yes.
-Got it.

162
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:19,953
I'll finish it off later.

163
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,546
Are you going to finish this?

164
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,799
-I'm not a beer person.
-May I?

165
00:10:33,925 --> 00:10:34,968
Thank you.

166
00:10:42,142 --> 00:10:43,602
So...

167
00:10:44,603 --> 00:10:46,730
Rhea's mother...

168
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,024
I mean, where is she...

169
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,447
It's a long story.

170
00:10:56,573 --> 00:11:00,118
If I tell you,
it will spoil our mood.

171
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,709
Yes, Priyanshu.

172
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:10,504
Yeah, we're all set.

173
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:14,674
Yeah, we'll be there.
Of course.

174
00:11:14,758 --> 00:11:17,094
Yeah, see you. Bye.

175
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,638
That was our VC.

176
00:11:20,138 --> 00:11:21,306
We have a solid spot.

177
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:23,392
The investor's quite excited to meet us.

178
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:25,644
-That's great.
-It's at Lonavala.

179
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,063
So be ready, we're going.

180
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:30,941
But weren't you and
Nikhil supposed to go?

181
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:34,236
Yeah, but Nikhil wants you there.

182
00:11:35,028 --> 00:11:36,863
What will I do there?

183
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,366
I don't have any experience.

184
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:41,868
It's always good to
have a girl on the team.

185
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,123
Listen, I'm not going to go there
as a glamour girl!

186
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:48,834
That's not what I meant.

187
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:51,878
It will be good for you.
I'm telling you, trust me.

188
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,047
-Are you sure?
-Hundred percent.

189
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,924
So, be ready.
I'll pick you up.

190
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,260
-Okay?
-Okay.

191
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:08,478
There's news from Kashmir
that your boy Sajid

192
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:09,896
has a lot of complaints.

193
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:12,190
You know how moody these boys can be.

194
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,316
No!

195
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:17,154
All I know is
Mission Zulfiqar has begun.

196
00:12:17,237 --> 00:12:18,989
And for it to succeed

197
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:21,241
everybody needs to
follow the orders.

198
00:12:22,284 --> 00:12:24,035
Tell that boy...

199
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,414
that nobody knows
everything about the mission.

200
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,459
So he should stop complaining

201
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:33,211
and focus on the work given to him.

202
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:36,590
-Or else, we have other ways--
-I'll talk to him.

203
00:12:37,215 --> 00:12:40,552
The problem is, Sajid doesn't
know who our other fighter is.

204
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,137
What do you mean?

205
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:48,435
Sajid and Moosa became good friends
at my training camp.

206
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:50,437
I know how to convince Sajid.

207
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,813
Then do it!

208
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:55,233
We cannot afford to waste any more time.

209
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:58,904
After this, I shouldn't get
a single call from Kashmir.

210
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,865
I'll take your leave now.

211
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,577
I'll see you again when we
finish this mission.

212
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,704
-Khuda hafiz. 
 -Khuda hafiz.

213
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,591
As-salaam alaikum, 
Basharat Bhai.

214
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,177
Why haven't you met him yet?

215
00:13:28,892 --> 00:13:30,519
We can deploy two units.

216
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:32,312
-We can position Unit Bravo.
-Okay.

217
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,898
And lead Unit Alpha ourselves,
and wait on the bridge.

218
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:36,775
-Yes?
-Srikant, there's an update for you.

219
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:38,318
We've just got intel

220
00:13:38,401 --> 00:13:41,238
that Basharat will attend
a wedding in Baramulla.

221
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:42,948
-We won't get a better opportunity.
-Good.

222
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:44,366
But we can't enter the village.

223
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:45,575
-Why?
-We'll wait outside

224
00:13:45,659 --> 00:13:46,826
and keep an eye on Basharat.

225
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,704
As soon as he leaves the
wedding, we'll get him.

226
00:13:49,788 --> 00:13:51,915
Why can't we arrest
him during the wedding?

227
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,167
Sir, Baramulla is often
referred to as "mini-Pakistan."

228
00:13:54,251 --> 00:13:55,335
Every house, every shop

229
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,337
has "Go India, go back,"
written on its walls.

230
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,755
The army is not welcome there.

231
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,466
Before mounting an operation
we need to get a clearance from the top.

232
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,386
If things go wrong, it will be
all over the news.

233
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:06,805
I don't get it.

234
00:14:07,973 --> 00:14:10,183
Why is he attending a wedding?

235
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,477
Because Basharat is no fool.

236
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:16,189
He knows that the army
monitors his every move.

237
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,441
So, why would the lion
step out of the jungle

238
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:20,235
and head towards the city?

239
00:14:20,402 --> 00:14:23,321
Sir, maybe he's sure we
won't get him in Baramulla.

240
00:14:23,405 --> 00:14:25,240
It's his hometown.

241
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:28,285
Or maybe he's got orders...

242
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,412
to attend the wedding.

243
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:34,165
Would he risk his life for an order?

244
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:37,335
What if he's coming
to meet the asset?

245
00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:39,504
It's a possibility, Saloni.

246
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,798
And even if the asset
does not show up

247
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,634
we'll know everything
once we get Basharat.

248
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,335
We have to wait here.

249
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:02,253
We can't go ahead.

250
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,045
Sri, come see this!

251
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,430
That's Basharat.

252
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:56,725
-Can you zoom in, please?
-Yes, ma'am.

253
00:16:59,102 --> 00:17:01,896
I can't believe Munni
is getting married today.

254
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,816
It seems like only yesterday...

255
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,902
when she was playing with her brothers.

256
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,823
May God bless both of them.

257
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:13,950
Can you lower it a bit, please?

258
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:16,828
Sorry, sir.
If we do that, we could be detected.

259
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:22,333
I know her brothers are
watching over her from heaven.

260
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,753
Come, Basharat Bhai.

261
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:39,768
This is the room, as you wanted.

262
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,604
Basharat Bhai...

263
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,564
Thank you so much.

264
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,609
You have blessed the
wedding with your presence.

265
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:50,111
Please don't embarrass me, Tariq Bhai.

266
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,866
Munni is like my daughter.
How could I not be here?

267
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,996
No. Your presence
is enough for us.

268
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,749
Don't worry. Please, keep it.

269
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:04,167
Basharat Bhai!

270
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:07,170
-As-salaam alaikum. 
 -Wa alaykumu as-salam.

271
00:18:07,295 --> 00:18:08,505
How are you?

272
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,340
I am good, by the grace of Allah!

273
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:12,175
-How are you?
 -Alhamdulillah!

274
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,094
Please do not go till the
marriage is solemnized.

275
00:18:15,178 --> 00:18:16,721
I'm not going anywhere.

276
00:18:16,805 --> 00:18:18,848
-I'll stay for the feast.
 -Inshallah.

277
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,934
Please make yourself comfortable.

278
00:18:22,185 --> 00:18:24,938
Who is Tariq?
How is he related to Basharat?

279
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:28,149
Tariq's two sons were
militants who got martyred.

280
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:31,486
Excuse me, could you please
stop calling them "martyrs"?

281
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:32,862
If a terrorist dies

282
00:18:32,946 --> 00:18:35,490
they call him a martyr
to get ten more recruits!

283
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:37,534
Sir, I was just using
the term they use.

284
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,994
Oh, really?
Do you feel the same way?

285
00:18:40,078 --> 00:18:43,498
Sir, do we need to prove
our loyalty every day?

286
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,541
Is that a problem?

287
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:46,543
Okay, guys! Chill!
Chill, please!

288
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,985
As-salaam alaikum. 
I am Sajid.

289
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:32,422
Did you know pigeons
used to be our postmen?

290
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:35,675
A pigeon used to fly across
the border with our message.

291
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:39,178
And another used to fly back.

292
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:43,975
Three months ago,
the BSF arrested a pigeon.

293
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,523
Some Kahwah?

294
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,317
Look...

295
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:53,860
I need to know

296
00:19:53,943 --> 00:19:56,154
whether I'll get to
speak to Faizan Bhai or not?

297
00:19:56,237 --> 00:19:58,281
It's been so many days!

298
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:00,992
Nobody has told me a thing.

299
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,328
I don't like to work like this.

300
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,872
I want to know
the whole mission...

301
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,875
and speak to Faizan Bhai.

302
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,252
Why are you so restless?

303
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,841
The Sajid that Faizan spoke about,
was not like this.

304
00:20:16,925 --> 00:20:19,010
It's been only two days
since you came to Kashmir.

305
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:20,845
And you're already full of anger.

306
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,764
Kashmir that does that to you.

307
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,518
I want to finish my
work and leave quickly.

308
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:35,193
Brother, the groom
wants to speak to you.

309
00:20:35,318 --> 00:20:36,486
Give him the phone.

310
00:20:37,153 --> 00:20:37,987
Okay.

311
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,615
Sir, we're tracing a satellite call.

312
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,824
Guys!

313
00:20:43,284 --> 00:20:45,161
-As-salaam alaikum, brother.
 -Wa alaykumu as-salam.

314
00:20:45,787 --> 00:20:47,413
How are you?

315
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:48,831
Everything's good.

316
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:51,125
Then why are you 
 not agreeing to the marriage?

317
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,002
I didn't do so.

318
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,464
I just want to
get to know the bride better.

319
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:00,843
If I'm going to sacrifice
my life for a girl...

320
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,179
I should be allowed
to make inquiries.

321
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:05,974
One makes inquiries only
when there's lack of trust.

322
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,726
Your elder brother
has chosen the bride.

323
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,061
Elder brother?

324
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:11,938
Your elder brother, Chettan.

325
00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:13,690
Chettan?

326
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,400
Is he attending the wedding?

327
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:18,194
Yes, I assure you,

328
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,406
he knows you
better than you know yourself.

329
00:21:21,781 --> 00:21:23,866
It's good that he
chose the bride.

330
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,827
Is there anything else I can do for you?

331
00:21:25,910 --> 00:21:28,162
No, your assurance is enough.

332
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,583
Have patience, 
 you'll get the details soon.

333
00:21:32,959 --> 00:21:34,335
I'll be waiting.

334
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,713
-Khuda hafiz. 
 -Khuda hafiz.

335
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,590
That's definitely code.

336
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,300
Can you run a voice
analysis on the two?

337
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,552
Yes, ma'am.

338
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:49,100
I was told that this is the most
critical mission of our fight.

339
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,728
That's why I have
come back to Kashmir

340
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,646
without caring about my safety...

341
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:56,941
to ensure that this
mission succeeds.

342
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,152
Remember...

343
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:02,822
you have been chosen
for this sacred task.

344
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,117
You are Allah's most special.

345
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,578
Don't mess it up.

346
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,247
The groom's voice doesn't match.

347
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,500
But the other one matches

348
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:16,044
with Faizan Ahmed's voice.

349
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,172
Fuck! He's on the CIA's most wanted list.

350
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:22,967
Faizan was speaking to our asset.

351
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:27,013
Who's Chettan? 
Any matches?

352
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:28,097
No, ma'am.

353
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,266
Chettan.

354
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:39,317
Could it be "Chettan" like
big brother in Malayalam?

355
00:22:39,734 --> 00:22:40,568
Malayalam?

356
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,945
Malayalis call their
big brother as Chettan.

357
00:22:45,490 --> 00:22:46,699
Moosa.

358
00:22:48,326 --> 00:22:49,744
Moosa is Chettan.

359
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,042
Vikram, I think
we should move in.

360
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,627
You can't, Srikant.

361
00:22:57,752 --> 00:23:00,213
I've already told you this,
the army cannot enter.

362
00:23:00,338 --> 00:23:02,256
But I can, unofficially.

363
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:04,008
Sir, it's too risky.

364
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:05,009
Fuck the risk.

365
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:08,471
Srikant, as your commanding officer,
I forbid you.

366
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,497
Don't take too much time, Srikant. 
 And keep your head down.

367
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,623
Okay.

368
00:23:35,706 --> 00:23:36,582
Sir, I'll wait here.

369
00:23:36,666 --> 00:23:38,417
If I go further, they'll recognize me.
Okay, sir?

370
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:39,669
Good luck.

371
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,382
-Try to blend in, Srikant.
 -Nobody will recognize me.

372
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,385
I'm wearing a Kashmiri dress.

373
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,178
My cheeks are rosy, like apples.

374
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,597
It's not funny, Srikant. 
 Please be careful.

375
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,019
As-salaam alaikum.

376
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,364
How do you say
"congratulations" in Kashmiri?

377
00:24:08,489 --> 00:24:09,657
Sri, please don't.

378
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,409
Tell me quickly.

379
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:14,495
-Mubaarak. 
-Give me a slightly longer phrase.

380
00:24:14,996 --> 00:24:16,205
As-salaam alaikum.

381
00:24:16,581 --> 00:24:18,416
Tuichu hat laikh mubaarak.

382
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:21,752
Wish me good luck.

383
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:25,715
As-salaam alaikum, Tariq Bhai.

384
00:24:25,798 --> 00:24:28,342
-Congratulations to you and your family!
-Congratulations!

385
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:15,014
That's Sajid. 
 He took up a three-year course

386
00:25:15,097 --> 00:25:17,433
but has been at it for six years now!

387
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,436
I think I got him.

388
00:25:20,561 --> 00:25:21,979
How do you know?

389
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,690
I never forget a person's face.

390
00:25:25,566 --> 00:25:27,485
Who are you talking to?

391
00:25:31,572 --> 00:25:34,116
My father. He's up there.

392
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:46,564
He knows something's up,
I'm going after him.

393
00:26:46,731 --> 00:26:47,732
Srikant, please don't!

394
00:27:23,017 --> 00:27:25,019
Firdaus, he's coming towards you.

395
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:26,228
Catch the motherfucker.

396
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,147
Copy. I'll stop him.

397
00:27:50,461 --> 00:27:51,879
Get me visuals, quick!

398
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:17,154
There he is!

399
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:31,752
Srikant, get back to base now.

400
00:28:31,836 --> 00:28:33,587
I'll catch him at any cost!

401
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,506
No, Srikant. It's not safe there.

402
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:37,883
Don't be a hero.
Get back to base now!

403
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:39,051
Shut up, Saloni!

404
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:40,719
We have our fucking
asses on the line here!

405
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,430
He never listens, Vikram!

406
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:53,983
Done running, motherfucker?

407
00:28:56,902 --> 00:28:59,238
I have the target,
send the backup.

408
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,614
Srikant, get out of there.

409
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,783
Abort and return to 
 base immediately.

410
00:29:02,867 --> 00:29:04,201
I repeat. Abort.

411
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:05,828
Shut up and send the backup.

412
00:29:06,871 --> 00:29:08,330
Srikant, get the fuck
out of there, right now!

413
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:10,207
We can't come in. I mean it!

414
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:13,669
Srikant! Sri... Srikant!

415
00:29:15,004 --> 00:29:16,213
Sit down.

416
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:17,840
Sit down.

417
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:24,638
Listen, motherfucker!
This is not a joke!

418
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:25,806
Sit down!

419
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,267
He has led Srikant back
to the wedding.

420
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:30,728
-We have to get him out.
-I'm going in right now.

421
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:34,064
Vikram, you can't go in.
Let me go.

422
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:37,193
-It's not safe.
-I got it.

423
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,319
Fuck!

424
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:40,488
I'll blow your brains out!

425
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:42,823
Sit!

426
00:29:43,199 --> 00:29:44,325
Brothers!

427
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:49,788
This man is from the army!
Indian Army!

428
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:52,500
He's come here to kill me.

429
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:55,836
He crashed the wedding.

430
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,838
These motherfuckers...

431
00:29:57,922 --> 00:30:00,716
forcibly enter our
homes and brutalize us.

432
00:30:01,050 --> 00:30:04,887
And if we protest,
they call us terrorists.

433
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,973
Another word, and I'll blow
your brains out, motherfucker!

434
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,725
I'll say a word!

435
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,186
A word which is on everybody's lips!

436
00:30:13,187 --> 00:30:15,356
-Freedom!
-Freedom!

437
00:30:15,439 --> 00:30:18,192
Listen to me, please!

438
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,735
Don't be fooled.

439
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,278
He's a fugitive.

440
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,323
He has nothing to do
with your struggle.

441
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:33,999
If anything happens to him
things will get out of hand.

442
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:35,167
Everybody will suffer.

443
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,170
He crashed the wedding to spy on us!

444
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,757
He wanted to kill one of our guests.

445
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,467
Sir, he's not a guest.

446
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:45,427
He's a wanted criminal and a terrorist.

447
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,138
-He's killed many innocents--
-You consider all of us terrorists!

448
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,056
Go back to India!

449
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,976
Freedom!
Freedom!

450
00:30:52,059 --> 00:30:54,395
Sir, you are misunderstanding me.

451
00:30:54,478 --> 00:30:55,896
That is not the issue.

452
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,274
That man is from Mumbai.

453
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,485
He's the prime suspect in a
recent scooter blast that took place there

454
00:31:01,569 --> 00:31:03,070
and we were after him.

455
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:06,073
Please listen to me, sir.
You know me.

456
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,702
I may be in the army...

457
00:31:10,244 --> 00:31:12,496
but I work for the
welfare of Kashmiris.

458
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,373
I'm a Kashmiri.

459
00:31:14,665 --> 00:31:16,584
Please, tell them to step back.

460
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,461
Otherwise, I'll be compelled
to call in my men.

461
00:31:19,837 --> 00:31:22,798
For the sake of Kashmir, I request you.

462
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:26,176
If anything happens to this man

463
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,636
the army will barge in.

464
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,430
Even I won't
be able to help you then.

465
00:31:29,513 --> 00:31:31,724
This valley has already
seen too much bloodshed.

466
00:31:32,516 --> 00:31:35,394
Why do you want to taint
this joyous occasion as well?

467
00:31:55,998 --> 00:31:57,291
Cigarette?

468
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,837
You don't smoke...

469
00:32:02,296 --> 00:32:04,131
you don't drink.

470
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:08,969
Do you fool around with girls?

471
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:11,347
Not that either?

472
00:32:12,681 --> 00:32:14,308
Stop playing that song.

473
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:16,393
What?

474
00:32:17,603 --> 00:32:19,730
I don't like Gujarati songs.

475
00:32:19,897 --> 00:32:23,984
Listen, asshole.
This is my truck!

476
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:26,278
I was the one who gave you a lift.

477
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:29,114
So I decide which song plays, got it?

478
00:32:30,366 --> 00:32:32,201
You're not giving me a free lift.

479
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,744
What?

480
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:39,583
What is it?

481
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,826
The road's shut.
Take the other route.

482
00:33:14,827 --> 00:33:18,330
You literally call the
shots in Srinagar.

483
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,458
There's a bloody curfew

484
00:33:21,792 --> 00:33:24,378
and we're sipping hot tea
at the town square.

485
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,881
It's oppression, in the name of security.

486
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:32,344
You really think so?

487
00:33:32,678 --> 00:33:36,306
We can do whatever we want
under AFSPA, and we do.

488
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,474
The result?

489
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:39,226
They launch an attack

490
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:40,853
and we enforce a curfew for weeks.

491
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,604
We shut down the internet

492
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:45,232
mobile services,
businesses, and schools.

493
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:47,067
We're oppressing them.

494
00:33:47,151 --> 00:33:49,445
And it's the children
who have to pay the price.

495
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:52,698
Here, the people are
entirely at our mercy.

496
00:33:53,282 --> 00:33:57,286
It's a crime to take
away a person's freedom.

497
00:33:58,287 --> 00:34:01,373
And then, there are so
many players in the game.

498
00:34:01,457 --> 00:34:03,834
Pakistan civil government,
the army, the ISI

499
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,878
our central government,
state government,

500
00:34:05,961 --> 00:34:07,588
local politicians
and the Hurriyat.

501
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:10,048
They are all playing
their own games...

502
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:14,344
but it's the Kashmiri people
caught in the crossfire.

503
00:34:14,428 --> 00:34:16,013
Sometimes it's difficult to figure out

504
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:18,807
who's right and who's wrong.

505
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,935
I mean, look at it from
their perspective.

506
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:25,355
In their eyes,
we are no different than the militants.

507
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:33,739
If only we had a regular job.
Simple and straight.

508
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,702
Wake up, go to work,
get your salary and go to sleep.

509
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:40,954
No need to rack your brains.

510
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:43,624
Just avoid any extra stress!

511
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:51,089
The problem is that our
work changes lives...

512
00:34:52,299 --> 00:34:54,301
and the future of the country.

513
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:57,387
You know what
Kulkarni used to say?

514
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,558
They need to win only once...

515
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,561
but we need to win every time.

516
00:35:06,146 --> 00:35:08,315
And, in the right way.

517
00:35:13,237 --> 00:35:16,073
How do you know that maulvi?

518
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,370
You spoke to him
as if he's an old friend.

519
00:35:21,662 --> 00:35:24,832
You can call it a friendship.
A convenient friendship.

520
00:35:25,666 --> 00:35:27,167
We share the objective

521
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:31,088
of stopping the bloodshed in Kashmir.

522
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:35,259
But more often than not, we fail.

523
00:35:38,512 --> 00:35:39,346
By the way,

524
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,348
-Major Vikram is very pissed at you.
-Why?

525
00:35:41,431 --> 00:35:43,934
He thinks Basharat
escaped because of you.

526
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:45,561
They were tracking him
for a long time now.

527
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:46,770
I'm very sorry about that.

528
00:35:46,854 --> 00:35:49,106
But it was imperative to catch Sajid.

529
00:35:49,189 --> 00:35:52,693
We missed that
fucker by a whisker.

530
00:35:53,193 --> 00:35:54,987
Don't worry, we'll find him.

531
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:57,155
Those bastards are very slippery.

532
00:35:57,239 --> 00:35:59,658
Once they slither out,
it's very difficult to find them.

533
00:35:59,741 --> 00:36:04,037
But now, we know who's
involved in Zulfiqar.

534
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:06,999
There's Faizan, then Moosa and Sajid.

535
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:10,168
Faizan is the worst!
He tells the other two to...

536
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,589
What happened?

537
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:18,260
We don't know where
Moosa and Sajid are.

538
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,014
But we do know where Faizan is.

539
00:36:22,097 --> 00:36:24,141
He's hiding somewhere in Balochistan.

540
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:25,517
Exactly.

541
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:29,313
And he is on the CIA's most wanted list.

542
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,357
He's hiding in Pakistan.
How will we find him?

543
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:35,736
I know a guy who can help us.

544
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,665
You're not on the run, are you?

545
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,627
No, I mean...

546
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:54,796
You... kind of...

547
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:58,091
You have that look.

548
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:02,220
These days, it's all over the news.

549
00:37:02,304 --> 00:37:05,891
I hope your mugshot
doesn't appear in the papers.

550
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,443
That's it.

551
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,031
You need to get down here.

552
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:24,409
I won't be going to the city.

553
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,495
I'll take a turn here.

554
00:37:29,831 --> 00:37:31,541
Shouldn't have given him a lift.
