1
00:00:18,394 --> 00:00:19,603
Yeah, come in!

2
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,857
Mr. Lennington.

3
00:00:23,232 --> 00:00:26,193
Srikant Tiwari of NIA is on the line
for you from India.

4
00:00:27,820 --> 00:00:30,156
-Yeah, put him through.
-Okay, thank you.

5
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:36,954
Getting a patch from Islamabad.

6
00:00:37,246 --> 00:00:39,707
Sir, connecting you to
Bruce Lennington in Islamabad.

7
00:00:41,834 --> 00:00:44,044
-Hi, Bruce.
-Hey, Srikant.

8
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:45,588
Been a while!
How have you been?

9
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:47,673
I've been fine. How are you?

10
00:00:47,757 --> 00:00:50,134
All good. What's happening?
What's up?

11
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:52,136
Okay, Bruce.
I have someone...

12
00:00:52,303 --> 00:00:54,513
you've been desperately
looking for.

13
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,933
-Go on. I'm all ears.
 -Faizan Ahmed.

14
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,811
-Tell me.
-I have his satellite number

15
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:02,521
and the location where he's hiding.

16
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,064
You're sure it's Faizan?

17
00:01:04,482 --> 00:01:05,816
Absolutely.

18
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,860
Where is he now?

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:11,280
Somewhere in Zhob province, 
 in Balochistan.

20
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:14,200
-You have his exact location?
-Not yet.

21
00:01:14,658 --> 00:01:15,951
But we'll get it.

22
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,037
But I need a favor from you in return.

23
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:19,413
What favor?

24
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:21,415
I want to have a chat
with him in person.

25
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,626
That...

26
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,586
I don't know how we're
going to achieve that.

27
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:26,754
I mean, assuming we do nab him

28
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:28,714
I'm not going to be able
to bring him to India.

29
00:01:30,132 --> 00:01:31,467
Well...

30
00:01:32,384 --> 00:01:34,845
If the mountain doesn't
come to Muḥammad...

31
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,308
Alright. What's the plan?

32
00:01:39,683 --> 00:01:41,143
Two words.

33
00:01:41,227 --> 00:01:43,229
Dzhokhar Dudayev.

34
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:45,356
And you think that will work?

35
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,150
Dzhokhar Dudayev was
a Chechen rebel.

36
00:01:48,234 --> 00:01:50,402
The KGB used a similar plan to get him.

37
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,196
You think this plan will work?

38
00:01:52,279 --> 00:01:53,823
With a bit of luck.

39
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:55,866
Just a second.
Yeah, Zoya?

40
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:57,660
Sir, the tech team has
processed the voice sample

41
00:01:57,743 --> 00:01:59,370
and they've sent us an
audio fingerprint back.

42
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,329
What do you think?

43
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,248
Sir, it might work, 
 but there's a problem.

44
00:02:02,331 --> 00:02:03,415
The sample is too short.

45
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:05,251
A longer sample would've worked better.

46
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:07,336
This is it, Zoya.
We don't have time.

47
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:08,420
-Send it!
-Okay, sir.

48
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:10,714
Sending it to you right away.
And, sir...

49
00:02:11,382 --> 00:02:13,467
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Zoya.

50
00:02:17,263 --> 00:02:18,806
Okay, these are the six safe houses

51
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:20,266
around the coordinates we received.

52
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:21,725
He could be hiding in any one of these.

53
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,686
Tracking all these
houses as we speak.

54
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,397
Beaming visuals onto the screens. 
 We've got tactical units

55
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,024
in striking distance
at all these locations. You copy?

56
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,901
Are you sure that these are
the only possible places

57
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,570
-where he could be?
 -I hope so.

58
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,238
These are the only locations we know

59
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:36,615
-that General Ansari uses.
-Okay.

60
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:37,867
How are things going on 
 at your end?

61
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,743
Well, using the voice sample

62
00:02:39,827 --> 00:02:42,204
from the conversation
of Sajid with Faizan

63
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,707
we've managed to put
together his voice profile.

64
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,876
I think we can manage with that.

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,127
Play it.

66
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:50,546
As-salaam alaikum, brother.

67
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,964
Hello, I can't hear you--

68
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,383
No. It's too clear.
Add some more noise.

69
00:02:56,552 --> 00:02:58,053
As-salaam alaikum, brother.

70
00:02:58,137 --> 00:02:59,847
Hello, I can't hear you, brother.

71
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,764
The network's bad.

72
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,558
Very good. Play this one.

73
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,894
-Bruce, we're ready.
-Copy.

74
00:03:05,477 --> 00:03:06,562
Connecting, sir.

75
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,399
All teams on standby
for target location.

76
00:03:10,482 --> 00:03:12,568
TU1 is active and ready to launch.

77
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,327
Try again.

78
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:23,495
-Negative, sir.
-Connecting again, sir.

79
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,417
Hello?

80
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:31,253
As-salaam alaikum, brother.

81
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,214
Wa alaykumu as-salam, Sajid.
All well?

82
00:03:34,298 --> 00:03:35,424
How did you find this number?

83
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,134
Hello, I can't hear you, brother.

84
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:39,219
-Play it.
-Hello!

85
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:41,096
Hello, I can't hear you, brother.

86
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:42,431
Wait, let me go to the terrace.

87
00:03:42,514 --> 00:03:43,849
We don't get network in the house.

88
00:03:45,643 --> 00:03:46,810
Focus, guys!

89
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:48,604
Come on.

90
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:51,649
-Bruce, did you see him?
-Where is he?

91
00:03:51,732 --> 00:03:52,942
Waiting for target confirmation, sir.

92
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,526
Hello, brother!

93
00:03:54,735 --> 00:03:57,154
-Hello. Can you hear me now?
-Play it.

94
00:03:57,613 --> 00:03:58,739
-Hello. 
-Hello?

95
00:03:58,822 --> 00:04:00,240
-I can't hear you. 
-Sajid?

96
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,992
-Do we have anything else?
-Nothing else, sir.

97
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:03,786
Fuck it! Play this on loop.

98
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:05,996
I can't hear you, brother!

99
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,916
-Hello, brother? 
-Hello.

100
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:10,709
-I can't hear you. 
 -Hello, Sajid!

101
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:11,877
The network's bad.

102
00:04:11,961 --> 00:04:13,754
There he is! Zoom in!

103
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:15,756
-Hello. 
 -I can't hear you.

104
00:04:16,298 --> 00:04:18,676
-Hello, Sajid? 
 -Hello, I can't hear you, brother.

105
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:21,261
-Where are you talking from, hell?
-Target locked, sir.

106
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:22,179
Srikant.

107
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,431
-We got him.
-Yes!

108
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,851
Bloody idiot!

109
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,514
What is this "Faizan" issue?

110
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:09,643
He was hiding in our country
and we didn't know?

111
00:05:09,727 --> 00:05:12,896
Bin Laden has already brought
us enough embarrassment.

112
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,816
We cannot go through that again.

113
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:18,235
The embassy has received a
call from the White House.

114
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,905
It's no secret that General Ansari
is responsible for this.

115
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:25,034
Apparently, the ISI is involved as well.

116
00:05:25,993 --> 00:05:27,619
General Khursheed...

117
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:30,706
this is a very serious matter.

118
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,541
I agree, sir.

119
00:05:33,292 --> 00:05:38,005
We are checking the travel records
of all our men and agents.

120
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,132
Whoever is responsible for
this will be exposed soon.

121
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,342
Hurry up with the investigations.

122
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:44,386
The Americans have threatened us

123
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,722
that they will stop giving us aid.

124
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,767
Speak to the Secretary of State.

125
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:52,186
-Yes, sir.
-That's all. Thank you.

126
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,361
General Khursheed.

127
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:03,822
Please wait.

128
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,995
-What's going on, Khursheed?
-I'm sorry, sir.

129
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,998
Ansari's men kept Faizan in hiding.

130
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:14,708
And what were you doing?

131
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:17,377
Why didn't you keep
an eye on Ansari?

132
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:18,962
We did, sir.

133
00:06:19,296 --> 00:06:22,883
We trace him every second
he's outside Balochistan.

134
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:26,011
But on his own turf, we can't do anything.

135
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,014
We need to clean up this mess.

136
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:32,768
What if we need to get rid of Ansari?

137
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:34,853
That won't be easy.

138
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:38,148
He fought a war for Pakistan.

139
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:40,484
He's received
the Nishan-e-Haider award.

140
00:06:40,692 --> 00:06:45,572
He knows the top brass
in the army and the ISI.

141
00:06:46,115 --> 00:06:50,285
Find out about his contacts in the ISI.

142
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:56,875
We need to tread very carefully.

143
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,473
Wow, Mom! Very cool!

144
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,852
You've never dressed up
like this for work.

145
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,187
Okay, listen.

146
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:19,606
I'm going for
an important conference to Lonavala.

147
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,733
I will take some time to come back.
Okay?

148
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,902
You're a grown-up.

149
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,863
Look after the house and your brother.

150
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:28,282
Make sure he doesn't play
video games all day.

151
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,367
Those are Math tutorials.

152
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,662
Not everything on the
tablet is a video game!

153
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:36,039
I have asked Aunt Neelam to cook for you.

154
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:37,833
Eat whatever she cooks.

155
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,793
Do not fuss or waste the food.

156
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:42,129
And don't mess up the house.
Okay?

157
00:07:42,212 --> 00:07:44,756
-If you want something to munch on--
-Mom!

158
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,133
Got it.

159
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,095
Forgot something else.

160
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,514
-Dhriti, get the door.
-Atharv.

161
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,349
Come on!

162
00:07:59,062 --> 00:07:59,897
Hi!

163
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,065
Atharv, right?

164
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:03,692
I'm Arvind.

165
00:08:04,651 --> 00:08:05,777
Mom?

166
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,487
Mom!

167
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,199
There's somebody at the door.

168
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,368
-Hi!
-Hi, Suchi.

169
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:14,661
-Come in.
-Hey, young lady!

170
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:16,079
You must be Dhriti, right?

171
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:18,457
Would you like to
have tea or coffee?

172
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,125
Filter coffee, if possible.

173
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:21,210
Sure.

174
00:08:21,293 --> 00:08:22,628
Hello!
Don't you have to go to school?

175
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:25,547
You're getting late.
Get up, come on! Go!

176
00:08:27,257 --> 00:08:28,383
Get up!

177
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:41,980
-Bye.
-Go.

178
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,654
Dhriti, lunch box.

179
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:51,406
-Who is he?
-I told you.

180
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,866
He's my colleague.

181
00:08:53,033 --> 00:08:56,954
It looks like you're going
for a picnic, not a conference.

182
00:09:05,963 --> 00:09:09,424
-Don't put too much sugar.
-Shit! You scared me!

183
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:12,761
-How's Rhea?
-She's feeling better.

184
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,304
My mom found out she's ill.

185
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,764
So, she took Rhea with her.

186
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,307
Thank God for grandmas!

187
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:18,392
-Listen.
-Here you go.

188
00:09:18,475 --> 00:09:19,518
Nikhil is coming from Delhi.

189
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:20,769
So he'll meet us at the venue.

190
00:09:20,852 --> 00:09:21,979
There's a start-up boot camp.

191
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:23,355
We'll be meeting our VCs over there.

192
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:24,523
Boot camp?

193
00:09:25,482 --> 00:09:28,568
The techies don't like
the word "conference."

194
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:31,697
So they call it "boot camp."
Sounds cooler.

195
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:35,867
Nice?

196
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,869
Authentic filter coffee!

197
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,749
Sir, the Americans won't budge.

198
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:46,461
They don't care about
Zulfiqar or its threat to us.

199
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,423
Sir, please! I want to interrogate Faizan.

200
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,508
We neither have time,
nor Moosa and Sajid.

201
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,677
Faizan trained both of them.

202
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,972
If anybody knows about their 
 location and plan, it is Faizan.

203
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,224
This is an extraordinary
request, Srikant.

204
00:09:59,308 --> 00:10:01,852
But this is an extraordinary
situation, sir!

205
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:04,938
You cannot go to
Balochistan officially.

206
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,774
That's alright, sir.
I can go unofficially.

207
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:09,943
What if you go unofficially...

208
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,904
and something happens to you?

209
00:10:13,739 --> 00:10:15,866
You won't be able to get me out of there.

210
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:18,076
Sir, I've made some mistakes

211
00:10:18,535 --> 00:10:21,163
which killed innocent people.

212
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:26,543
Sir, this is my only
chance to redeem myself.

213
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:30,672
My life or any other life 
 it isn't bigger than Zulfiqar.

214
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,424
Sir, my gut feeling says

215
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,801
something terrible will happen...

216
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,555
and no one can
imagine its extent.

217
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:45,228
Qazi is a bastard!

218
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:46,355
It's shameful

219
00:10:46,438 --> 00:10:50,108
that a coward like him is the
Prime Minister of Pakistan.

220
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:54,404
I am sure he must have
led the CIA to Faizan.

221
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,949
That son of a bitch
dances to the tune of the whites.

222
00:10:58,033 --> 00:11:01,286
And his butler, Khursheed!
Both the bastards--

223
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:04,039
Sir, I suggest
we commence phase two.

224
00:11:04,206 --> 00:11:06,249
And what about Faizan?

225
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,752
Do you think he'll spill the beans?

226
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,463
Sir, Faizan barely knows
anything about Zulfiqar.

227
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,882
But he could lead them to us.

228
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,801
And you know our Prime Minister.

229
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:18,970
The moment he finds out,
he'll try to stop us at any cost.

230
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,598
You're right.
Maybe it's time.

231
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:23,517
Are we ready?

232
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,395
We can start phase two in
the next 48 hours.

233
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:27,938
Sameer...

234
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:32,192
we are nearing the end of our mission.

235
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:36,488
With Allah's grace,
this mission will be a success.

236
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,656
Inshallah!

237
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,409
I'll ensure it succeeds, sir.

238
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:46,373
The jet belongs to
this guy from Delhi.

239
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:49,626
He's one of the many businessmen doing
infrastructure work in Afghanistan.

240
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:52,087
This plane will touchdown
in Kandahar for a while.

241
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:54,631
RAW's asset, Mustafa,
will meet you there.

242
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,633
Balochistan is a two-hour
drive from there.

243
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,051
He'll take you there.

244
00:11:58,135 --> 00:12:02,472
Srikant, you know that this
is completely off the record.

245
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:05,100
If you're caught,
you're on your own.

246
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,185
We cannot extract you.

247
00:12:08,353 --> 00:12:09,813
I know the risks.

248
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,070
Are you sure about this?

249
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:21,408
There are other ways to
get information from Faizan.

250
00:12:21,533 --> 00:12:23,743
We don't have time for that.

251
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,788
I should've done this
a long time ago, Saloni.

252
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:32,169
Good luck, Srikant.

253
00:12:49,978 --> 00:12:50,896
Hi.

254
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:52,522
Welcome to the boot camp, sir.

255
00:12:52,606 --> 00:12:53,648
-Hello, sir.
-Hi.

256
00:12:53,732 --> 00:12:54,816
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hi.

257
00:12:54,941 --> 00:12:56,902
-Your name, sir?
-Arvind and Suchitra.

258
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,029
Okay.
Ma'am, Arvind and Suchitra.

259
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:01,698
Okay.

260
00:13:03,074 --> 00:13:04,618
-Your card, sir.
-Thank you.

261
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,369
-Yours, ma'am.
-Thank you.

262
00:13:06,453 --> 00:13:08,205
-And your keys.
-Thanks.

263
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:09,331
-All the best, sir.
-Thank you.

264
00:13:09,414 --> 00:13:10,665
-All the best, ma'am.
-Thank you.

265
00:13:10,957 --> 00:13:12,375
-Let's freshen up.
-Yeah.

266
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:15,670
So, Nikhil wants to do
the opening remarks.

267
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:17,172
Glad you came.

268
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:18,673
Because with all these men around,

269
00:13:18,757 --> 00:13:20,175
-you'll create a--
-Arvind!

270
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,219
Listen...

271
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,803
-Are you done?
-Yeah.

272
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,390
-Thank you, thank you so much.
-Sorry.

273
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:29,392
Never mind.

274
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,980
You know what? I feel
you should speak too.

275
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:37,651
Because Nikhil tends to get
too technical sometimes.

276
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,695
You're more natural.
You can do it charmingly.

277
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:43,657
Charming?
I'm flattered, thank you.

278
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,992
What I mean...

279
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:49,454
is that you can
manipulate words.

280
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:50,622
Wow!

281
00:13:51,081 --> 00:13:53,291
What a backhanded compliment!

282
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:54,543
-Thank you!
-You're welcome.

283
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,719
Take this.

284
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,222
So the story is that
your name is Fahd Ahmed.

285
00:14:07,305 --> 00:14:08,598
Fahd Ahmed?

286
00:14:08,682 --> 00:14:10,767
You have a spices business in Karachi.

287
00:14:10,892 --> 00:14:12,477
We are business partners.

288
00:14:12,561 --> 00:14:15,105
And we are travelling to
Quetta for work.

289
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,858
-Are you from Mumbai?
-Yes.

290
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:20,110
Great!

291
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,195
It's an incredible city!

292
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:24,281
I have seen it a lot in the movies.

293
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,157
But never got a chance to visit it.

294
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:29,661
It seems that my dream
of visiting India...

295
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,871
will always remain a dream.

296
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:36,418
How long have you been in Balochistan?

297
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,838
-Almost 17 years now.
-17 years! My God!

298
00:14:39,921 --> 00:14:42,090
I am from Patiala.
Jasmeet Singh.

299
00:14:42,173 --> 00:14:43,550
Jasmeet Singh?

300
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,136
I changed my name and came
here during the rebellion.

301
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:48,513
I thought of returning after two years.

302
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,309
But I postponed it every year
in the last 17 years.

303
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:55,061
Now, I am Mustafa from Quetta.

304
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:02,902
Don't you miss your city, your family?

305
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:05,822
I stay with my wife and children.

306
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:09,492
I lost my parents a few years ago.

307
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,579
But I wasn't able to go home.

308
00:15:13,038 --> 00:15:16,916
Very few can make such
sacrifices for the nation.

309
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:21,087
Back home,
people just talk about patriotism.

310
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:23,173
Nationalists!

311
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,925
We have settled here now,
it's a nice place.

312
00:15:26,343 --> 00:15:29,179
I have no complaints.
Now, this is our home.

313
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:32,724
But fear lurks, even at home.

314
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,061
If my cover is blown,

315
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:41,191
they'll take me away
and slaughter me like a dog.

316
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,529
Don't think of such things.

317
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:49,824
-What about your family?
-Of course. Here, have a look.

318
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,870
These two are the little Avengers,
with Thanos in the middle.

319
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:57,374
Mashallah! God bless!

320
00:16:02,295 --> 00:16:03,505
Perception management

321
00:16:03,588 --> 00:16:05,840
is an equally big challenge
in the field of mental health.

322
00:16:05,924 --> 00:16:08,551
We've factored in the cost
of educating the support system

323
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:09,969
friends and family,

324
00:16:10,053 --> 00:16:12,222
on how to deal with people
with mental health issues.

325
00:16:12,347 --> 00:16:14,391
We plan to take out
social media campaigns

326
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:18,061
and ads on television, outreach
programmes and events in colleges.

327
00:16:18,228 --> 00:16:21,606
Reaching out to young
influencers is a key priority.

328
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:23,900
Any questions?

329
00:16:27,237 --> 00:16:28,947
Please feel free if you
have any questions

330
00:16:29,030 --> 00:16:31,658
or if you need any
more clarifications.

331
00:16:31,741 --> 00:16:32,867
I must assure you one thing.

332
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,829
There are not many models of such
kind in the market right now.

333
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,540
We're doing it out of passion
and of course,

334
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,750
financial viability.

335
00:16:41,292 --> 00:16:43,211
So, any questions?

336
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:46,965
Arvind, can I add a few points?

337
00:16:47,048 --> 00:16:49,050
-Yes, sure.
-Sure?

338
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:56,307
Hi, everyone. I'm Suchitra Iyer.

339
00:16:56,433 --> 00:16:59,436
And I'd just like to add a few
points to what Nikhil said.

340
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,730
Normally, when others have
a small problem

341
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:05,942
like a swollen finger
or a toothache...

342
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:08,737
or a cough or cold,
what do we suggest them?

343
00:17:08,987 --> 00:17:10,488
To go see a doctor.

344
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,824
If someone says
"I'm feeling too low.

345
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:15,285
I'm feeling too depressed," or
"I'm not in the mood."

346
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,953
What do we suggest them?

347
00:17:17,287 --> 00:17:19,789
"Come on, let's grab a drink."
And the worst thing is

348
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:22,250
"Get some action tonight
and you'll be fine."

349
00:17:23,251 --> 00:17:24,377
The problem is

350
00:17:24,461 --> 00:17:27,005
we don't give as much
importance to mental health

351
00:17:27,297 --> 00:17:29,340
as we give to physical health.

352
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:34,387
If our body has a problem,
we look for solutions.

353
00:17:34,512 --> 00:17:37,098
But if anybody
needs mental help

354
00:17:37,182 --> 00:17:38,475
which I strongly believe

355
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,602
that we all do at
some point of time.

356
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,229
Then, we don't know what to do.

357
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,981
And we won't do anything

358
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:48,359
for the fear of being laughed at.

359
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,863
This is where we
would like to come in.

360
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:56,451
We want to make sure that we not
only have easy access to help.

361
00:17:56,743 --> 00:18:00,038
But we have to fight this
taboo of seeking help.

362
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:03,750
For the last 12 years,
I was living in my comfort zone.

363
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,085
I had a safe,
happy, and easy job.

364
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:09,631
Overnight, I decided that I'd
quit this job and I did.

365
00:18:09,839 --> 00:18:11,633
I joined this company

366
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:14,135
where nothing is easy.

367
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,929
There are no benefits...

368
00:18:16,304 --> 00:18:17,680
and there is no money.

369
00:18:17,972 --> 00:18:19,557
Well, not yet, of course.

370
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:22,227
Believe you me, we do not have an office.

371
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:25,605
We have worked out of cafes
all over, except Starbucks.

372
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,607
Quite frankly, we can't afford it yet.

373
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,151
But seriously...

374
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:34,239
each one of us is
attached to this company.

375
00:18:35,198 --> 00:18:36,825
And the reason for that...

376
00:18:38,076 --> 00:18:39,786
is the idea behind it.

377
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:41,579
Which is very beautiful.

378
00:18:46,668 --> 00:18:48,837
-Thank you.
-Great job, guys. We nailed it.

379
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,880
-Cheers to that.
-Cheers.

380
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,633
Guys, you know what?

381
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:55,760
I see Priyanshu there.
I'll be right back.

382
00:18:56,052 --> 00:18:57,595
-All the best.
-Thanks.

383
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,765
-He's super excited.
-Yeah, he looks it also.

384
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,433
Listen.

385
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:06,062
I was a bit scared when
you said you wanted to speak.

386
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:08,273
I didn't know what you would say.

387
00:19:08,439 --> 00:19:10,817
But when you started,
you were flawless.

388
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:13,570
So, congratulations!

389
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,447
I can't believe I actually did it.

390
00:19:18,241 --> 00:19:20,493
-You liked it?
-I loved it.

391
00:19:22,036 --> 00:19:25,164
-Atharv, switch off the TV.
-Why?

392
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:27,584
You watched it for an hour.
That's enough.

393
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:29,919
We have to be at Aunt Neelam's for dinner.

394
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:31,754
Come on, get up.
Let's go.

395
00:19:32,005 --> 00:19:33,882
Don't try to be Mom.

396
00:19:38,970 --> 00:19:41,723
-Hello, Mom.
-Did you guys have dinner?

397
00:19:44,851 --> 00:19:46,269
No, we were about to leave.

398
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,353
You're leaving now?

399
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:49,480
Aunt Neelam must be waiting.
Go right away.

400
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:51,024
Yes, Mom, we are going.

401
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:52,650
By the way...

402
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:54,611
I will be late.

403
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:57,864
If you want, you two can sleep 
 at Aunt Neelam's.

404
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,616
No. We'll sleep here.

405
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,952
Okay, listen.

406
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,080
Latch the main door properly. 
 Okay? Don't forget about it.

407
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:08,625
Mom, are you going to take longer?

408
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,377
Yes, it does seem like it.
I will take time.

409
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:14,005
But I promise I'll be back 
 as soon as possible. Alright?

410
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,174
Okay. Don't worry, we're fine.

411
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,343
Okay, bye.

412
00:20:32,982 --> 00:20:36,027
Leave the talking to me.
Just pretend to be asleep.

413
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:45,203
Papers?

414
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,080
Here.

415
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,003
What were you doing
in Afghanistan?

416
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,381
We have a spices business.

417
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,759
What's wrong with him? Hello.

418
00:21:00,635 --> 00:21:02,261
He's been up all night.

419
00:21:03,596 --> 00:21:06,015
He's my business partner...

420
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:07,725
from Karachi.

421
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,781
I think they're suspicious.

422
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:27,537
We need to search you.

423
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,915
-Are you married?
-What?

424
00:21:31,082 --> 00:21:32,625
Have you been married?

425
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,919
Yes, twice.

426
00:21:35,044 --> 00:21:38,256
My God! Twice!

427
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:45,471
Here, buy some gifts for your wives.

428
00:21:46,472 --> 00:21:51,060
Take it. My time is more
important than money.

429
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,896
I'd like it if you sped things up.

430
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,568
Let them go.

431
00:22:05,199 --> 00:22:06,367
Thank you.

432
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:09,078
-Khuda hafiz. 
 -Khuda hafiz.

433
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,460
What were you doing?

434
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,712
He was a soldier,
not an Indian policeman.

435
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:21,424
You bribed him!
What if he had arrested us?

436
00:22:21,883 --> 00:22:24,010
Bribery works everywhere, Jasmeet.

437
00:22:24,135 --> 00:22:25,636
You saw the other soldier who went in?

438
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,764
He was speaking on the phone
without dialing a number.

439
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,183
-He was trying to threaten us.
-I see.

440
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:32,435
Indian policemen do
take bribes sometimes...

441
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,520
but even they are not this stupid.

442
00:23:19,482 --> 00:23:20,566
Guess what!

443
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,318
-We got it.
-Yes!

444
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,445
We did it guys!
We did it!

445
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,781
-Okay!
-Where's the fucking champagne?

446
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:28,324
-Waiter!
-What?

447
00:23:28,533 --> 00:23:30,827
Here. It's time to celebrate.
We have to celebrate.

448
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,162
-To Shrink Me!
-Cheers!

449
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,497
Cheers to you.

450
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:38,209
One more. Champagne!

451
00:23:41,838 --> 00:23:42,964
-Happy birthday.
-Thanks!

452
00:23:43,047 --> 00:23:44,257
-Happy birthday.
-Thank you.

453
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,592
What's up!

454
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:52,765
Wow! You finally made it!

455
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:54,809
I thought you'd never come.

456
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,910
Let's crash for a bit and
leave early in the morning.

457
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,954
I want to reach before the kids wake up.

458
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:01,792
Hey, D!

459
00:25:03,628 --> 00:25:04,545
Here.

460
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:06,839
Check this out.

461
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,091
Try it.

462
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:11,093
You don't know what
you're missing out on.

463
00:25:11,177 --> 00:25:13,137
One should try everything in life.

464
00:25:13,596 --> 00:25:14,513
Try it once.

465
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,265
Later, you'll be asking me for it.

466
00:25:16,390 --> 00:25:17,558
Try it.

467
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:20,269
-Try it.
-I said no!

468
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,480
Fine. Your loss.

469
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:42,625
Just go home.

470
00:25:43,292 --> 00:25:44,794
I don't even know why I called you!

471
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,462
You're such a loser!

472
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:47,880
Just go!

473
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,131
Go!

474
00:27:02,997 --> 00:27:04,332
Dhriti!

475
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,084
Dhriti!

476
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:09,670
Dhriti!

477
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,048
Are you crying?

478
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,259
I won't tell Mom
that you went out!

479
00:27:15,551 --> 00:27:18,763
Atharv, please go away.
I'm coming, okay?

480
00:27:18,888 --> 00:27:21,307
Please, Dhriti.
Don't cry.

481
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:23,976
Please!

482
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:43,639
I'M FEELING BAD FOR
TAKING UP THE WHOLE BED

483
00:29:08,956 --> 00:29:11,333
I CAN'T SLEEP

484
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,921
ME NEITHER

485
00:30:03,761 --> 00:30:07,139
The CIA has kept Faizan in a
safe house in this city.

486
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:10,809
He's being monitored closely
by five men.

487
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:12,603
It's a secret location.

488
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,940
What about the guys
I had mentioned about?

489
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,485
They're on the way,
they must be arriving soon.

490
00:30:19,985 --> 00:30:21,946
We'll need to wait a bit though.

491
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:30,829
We'll wait here.

492
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,957
Our team should be here by morning.

493
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:31,974
What happened, darling?

494
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,475
What's wrong?

495
00:31:42,985 --> 00:31:44,737
He was born a monkey, right?

496
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,322
That's true.

497
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:49,491
He had a long tail as well.

498
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,620
We had it removed through
a complicated surgery.

499
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,957
Mom, you must have a few
pictures from our childhood.

500
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,001
Of course.
I'll show them to you.

501
00:32:01,503 --> 00:32:02,713
Stop it!

502
00:32:13,307 --> 00:32:14,642
Hi, Suchi.

503
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,019
-Hi.
 -Is everything alright?

504
00:32:17,227 --> 00:32:18,562
How are the children?

505
00:32:18,896 --> 00:32:19,730
How are you?

506
00:32:20,189 --> 00:32:21,774
The kids are fine.

507
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:24,360
You tell me. How are you?

508
00:32:24,526 --> 00:32:26,528
And what's going on?

509
00:32:26,654 --> 00:32:27,946
All is well.

510
00:32:28,530 --> 00:32:30,449
The usual files and paperwork.

511
00:32:33,744 --> 00:32:34,787
When are you coming back?

512
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,125
I want to come back soon.
But...

513
00:32:40,501 --> 00:32:41,627
Let's see.

514
00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:47,675
Is everything okay at home?

515
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,097
Yes, everything is fine here.

516
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,724
Don't worry about us.

517
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,978
Your work is important. 
 Focus on it.

518
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,315
Finish it and come back.

519
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:06,151
Sri...

520
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,779
as soon as possible.

521
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,448
They are here.

522
00:33:11,657 --> 00:33:12,866
I need to go now.

523
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:13,992
Okay?

524
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:20,708
Thank you.

525
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,304
Hello!

526
00:34:17,306 --> 00:34:18,932
What's happening?

527
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,311
Hello!

528
00:34:27,816 --> 00:34:30,194
-Untie him!
-What's happening?

529
00:34:30,611 --> 00:34:32,404
There's no time to talk.

530
00:34:32,529 --> 00:34:35,032
Get out of here before
someone finds out.

531
00:34:35,616 --> 00:34:36,784
Let's go.

532
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:46,752
Faizan, let's go!

533
00:35:27,501 --> 00:35:29,169
Thank you for saving my life.

534
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:31,922
-Are you from the Pakistan Army?
-We are from the ISI.

535
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:37,511
The Prime Minister himself
planned this operation.

536
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,054
The Prime Minister?

537
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,432
Listen to me carefully, Faizan.

538
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,812
We had no clue that
you were in Pakistan.

539
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,022
Or that you got caught.

540
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,734
It was very embarrassing
for the Prime Minister.

541
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:57,656
Pakistan already has
a bad reputation.

542
00:35:57,906 --> 00:35:59,491
And when the world finds out

543
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:01,451
that we were harboring
a terrorist...

544
00:36:01,869 --> 00:36:04,246
we'll have to face more ridicule.

545
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:06,874
All the nations in the
world will blacklist us.

546
00:36:07,291 --> 00:36:09,126
I was only following
the sacred word of--

547
00:36:09,209 --> 00:36:10,586
Stop that nonsense!

548
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:14,423
Save that for your recruits!

549
00:36:14,548 --> 00:36:15,757
Got it?

550
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:17,968
You don't do it for God.

551
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:19,803
You do it for the American dollars.

552
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,972
-But I--
-Shut up! Don't you understand?

553
00:36:22,139 --> 00:36:23,891
The Prime Minister got a call

554
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:27,227
from the Indian Prime Minister
threatening us with war.

555
00:36:27,603 --> 00:36:31,315
Have you sent two of your boys
to India for a mission?

556
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,067
-Mission...
-Zulfiqar.

557
00:36:34,151 --> 00:36:35,694
Mission Zulfiqar.

558
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:39,156
You have two options, Faizan.

559
00:36:39,281 --> 00:36:41,950
Tell those two guys to
immediately abort the mission

560
00:36:42,034 --> 00:36:43,911
and give us their location.

561
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:47,873
A car is waiting for you
at the end of this tunnel.

562
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:50,542
It will take you straight to the airport.

563
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:56,548
Here's your Saudi passport
and a ticket to Riyadh.

564
00:36:56,632 --> 00:37:00,677
It's a parting gift
from the Prime Minister.

565
00:37:00,761 --> 00:37:02,763
We know that you
funnel all your money

566
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:06,016
into a secret account in Saudi.

567
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:11,730
Say goodbye to Pakistan
and lead a peaceful life.

568
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:17,152
Or, stay six feet under the ground
in Pakistan,

569
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,738
buried in an unmarked grave.

570
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:23,992
We don't want Pakistan's name
dragged through the mud

571
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:26,119
because of you.

572
00:37:29,331 --> 00:37:31,249
What do you want to do?

573
00:37:32,334 --> 00:37:34,086
Can I go to Sudan?

574
00:37:35,295 --> 00:37:37,547
I don't like the
climate in Saudi.

575
00:37:43,845 --> 00:37:45,847
Is the climate in Sudan good?

576
00:37:58,485 --> 00:38:00,153
Who are these people?

577
00:38:00,237 --> 00:38:02,406
They'll be taking you to the airport.

578
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,620
Motherfucker!

579
00:38:08,787 --> 00:38:11,373
Bastard! You betrayed me!

580
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:13,417
I'll screw each one of you!

581
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,751
Bastard!

582
00:38:14,835 --> 00:38:16,420
I hope you got what
you wanted from him.

583
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,588
Got something.
But thank you, Bruce.

584
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:21,341
-Thank you for your help.
-Anytime, Srikant.

585
00:38:24,678 --> 00:38:27,097
Sir, both Moosa and Sajid
have been trained by Faizan.

586
00:38:27,222 --> 00:38:28,557
A few years ago

587
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,308
Lashkar-e-Taiba
got their hands on

588
00:38:30,434 --> 00:38:31,935
a stockpile of nerve gas in POK.

589
00:38:32,019 --> 00:38:33,812
This was later seized by the ISI.

590
00:38:33,895 --> 00:38:37,691
Then, Major Sameer and Ansari 
 planned a secret mission.

591
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:38,859
Mission Zulfiqar.

592
00:38:38,942 --> 00:38:40,944
Over a few years,
they slowly smuggled it

593
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:44,656
in small quantities
across the border, into Kashmir.

594
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:47,826
The nerve gas has been 
 stockpiled in a hideout in Kashmir.

595
00:38:47,909 --> 00:38:49,369
The original plan was that

596
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:51,371
Moosa and Asif would enter India,

597
00:38:51,455 --> 00:38:54,958
Asif would get all the nerve gas 
 from Kashmir into Delhi,

598
00:38:55,125 --> 00:38:57,294
and Moosa would make 
 a bomb in Delhi.

599
00:38:57,377 --> 00:39:00,422
But after Asif was caught,
Faizan chose Sajid for this task.

600
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:03,467
Sajid is sharper and
much more dangerous.

601
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:04,843
If my guess is right

602
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,306
then Sajid is currently
getting the nerve gas to Delhi.

603
00:39:09,514 --> 00:39:10,974
Moosa is hiding somewhere.

604
00:39:11,058 --> 00:39:13,143
And these two will meet in Delhi.

605
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:15,604
Nerve gas attack in Delhi.

606
00:39:17,022 --> 00:39:18,774
-What a disaster!
 -Yes, sir.

607
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:22,152
This time they didn't go for 
 terrorist attacks like 26/11

608
00:39:22,235 --> 00:39:23,278
or the parliament attack

609
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,656
which were eventually blamed on 
 independent terrorist groups.

610
00:39:26,948 --> 00:39:30,118
Nerve gas attack
means an act of war.

611
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,497
And this is not possible
without the government support.

612
00:39:33,789 --> 00:39:34,831
Which means the Indian government

613
00:39:34,915 --> 00:39:36,833
will have to go to 
 war with Pakistan.

614
00:39:37,209 --> 00:39:39,628
This will give General Ansari
an opportunity

615
00:39:39,753 --> 00:39:41,004
to carry out a coup.

616
00:39:41,088 --> 00:39:43,465
And soon, they'll get control
over the Pakistan government.

617
00:39:43,548 --> 00:39:45,717
Sir, Major Sameer has 
 all the information.

618
00:39:45,801 --> 00:39:48,011
I think we should involve 
 the government of Pakistan.

619
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:49,429
We have to work together.

620
00:39:49,721 --> 00:39:51,640
If this mission is successful

621
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:54,601
then this will be disastrous
for both the countries.

622
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:58,480
-Good job, Srikant.
-Yeah, good job, Srikant.

623
00:40:01,316 --> 00:40:02,734
Thank you, sir.

624
00:40:18,708 --> 00:40:19,960
Thanks for waiting, sir.

625
00:40:20,043 --> 00:40:22,337
The honorable PM will join 
 this call in a moment.

626
00:40:22,462 --> 00:40:23,880
Thank you.

627
00:40:26,133 --> 00:40:28,718
-Hello, Mr. Kulkarni. 
-Sir.

628
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:30,345
I have been briefed thoroughly

629
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:32,055
about the seriousness 
 of the situation.

630
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,516
I have only one question, Mr. Kulkarni.

631
00:40:34,891 --> 00:40:37,352
And I want a straight and clear answer.

632
00:40:37,978 --> 00:40:40,355
Do they really have 
 a stockpile of nerve gas?

633
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:42,941
Yes, sir.

634
00:40:43,024 --> 00:40:45,527
Mr. Kulkarni, we cannot afford a war.

635
00:40:45,694 --> 00:40:47,863
But if a nerve gas attack 
 is carried out on us

636
00:40:47,988 --> 00:40:50,282
we'll have to retaliate.

637
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:54,161
We will have to unwillignly 
 go to war with Pakistan.

638
00:40:54,286 --> 00:40:55,871
I need a solution to this problem.

639
00:40:55,954 --> 00:40:57,664
Let me know what I can do to help.

640
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:01,501
Sir, you'll need to speak to
the Prime Minister of Pakistan.

641
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:06,089
You'll need to convince him
to stop his men...

642
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:09,092
and give us the information...

643
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:11,928
that we need.

644
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,182
How sure are you about 
 this information?

645
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,561
One of our agents is in
Balochistan right now...

646
00:41:20,228 --> 00:41:22,230
and I have full faith in him.
