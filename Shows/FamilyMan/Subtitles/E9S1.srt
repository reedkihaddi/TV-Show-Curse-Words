1
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,616
-Are you lost?
-Rashid, wait.

2
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:25,831
Sajid, you're still alive?

3
00:03:26,498 --> 00:03:29,251
I thought you were
killed at the wedding.

4
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:32,296
Allah wants you to win, Sajid.

5
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:05,329
Is this what I think it is?

6
00:04:06,121 --> 00:04:07,706
-Yes.
 -Chettan!

7
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:11,752
I should have known.

8
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:18,217
We brought these canisters
one by one, across the border.

9
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,302
It took us three years.

10
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,179
We were waiting for you.

11
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,354
I'll need a vehicle.

12
00:04:31,397 --> 00:04:32,439
It will be arranged.

13
00:04:33,357 --> 00:04:34,358
When do you need it?

14
00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:36,068
How many canisters
are you taking?

15
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:43,325
All of them.

16
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:26,493
Okay, okay.

17
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:28,871
Thank you.

18
00:05:29,955 --> 00:05:31,373
No, no!

19
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:33,459
No, no, no!

20
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,351
I need an update every hour.

21
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,187
Set up checkpoints

22
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,064
at all the entries and exits of the city.

23
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,524
Speed up!

24
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,823
You're telling me Kareem's
girlfriend got a text from him...

25
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:06,033
accidentally?

26
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:08,619
A text from a dead man's phone!

27
00:06:10,496 --> 00:06:12,331
We're done for!

28
00:06:14,291 --> 00:06:16,210
-Did you tell anybody?
-No, sir.

29
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:18,921
Nobody should find out about this. Got it?

30
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:21,048
What do we do now, sir?

31
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:24,093
What do we do?

32
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,933
Who was that the policeman
who posed as a tea-seller?

33
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:32,476
Shinde?

34
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:33,644
Yes.

35
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:35,646
Get him on the phone.

36
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,312
As-salaam alaikum, General Ansari.

37
00:07:18,147 --> 00:07:19,690
Wa alaykumu as-salam, sir.

38
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:23,652
I hope I haven't disturbed
you by arriving unannounced.

39
00:07:23,861 --> 00:07:26,029
But... why are you here?

40
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,990
It was a very urgent matter.

41
00:07:28,407 --> 00:07:30,409
I couldn't afford to wait.

42
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,743
Please sit.

43
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,003
Let me get to the point, General Ansari.

44
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,175
The Indian PM called me
about a mission

45
00:07:46,383 --> 00:07:48,886
that was being executed
right under our noses...

46
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,471
and we have no clue about it.

47
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,391
I don't quite understand.

48
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:56,768
Zulfiqar.

49
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,979
Who's that?

50
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,982
General Ansari

51
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:05,736
I haven't come all the way here
to waste your time or mine.

52
00:08:06,195 --> 00:08:08,488
Given the circumstances,

53
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:10,824
we cannot afford to go to war with India.

54
00:08:11,241 --> 00:08:13,994
It will shatter our economy.

55
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:19,208
And it will take us decades to rebuild it.

56
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:21,001
Sir.

57
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,085
I maybe an army officer.

58
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,587
But I'm first and foremost, a Pakistani.

59
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,131
I would never want...

60
00:08:26,465 --> 00:08:29,676
the Pakistani citizens to suffer.

61
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,596
Trust me.

62
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:35,557
I don't know anything about Zulfiqar.

63
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:38,977
The hearing on your corruption case
is next month, right?

64
00:08:39,895 --> 00:08:41,647
There are many who wish

65
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:44,524
that the judge does not
rule in your favor.

66
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,735
I just wanted to remind you that.

67
00:08:48,904 --> 00:08:50,489
Thank you, sir.

68
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:55,035
But there are many who
want the ruling in my favor.

69
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,330
And if that doesn't happen...

70
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,292
they can cause a lot of
trouble for your government.

71
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:07,005
I'm aware of your influence in
this province and in the military.

72
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:10,342
If you ensure that
Zulfiqar is prevented

73
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:14,972
the corruption case against
you will be closed forever.

74
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,766
No matter what I do...

75
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:21,603
the ones carrying out Zulfiqar
won't stop.

76
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:26,191
No general in Balochistan
will oppose you.

77
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,568
Your wish is their command.

78
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,488
There's only one
person I'm worried about.

79
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,782
Major Sameer from the ISI.

80
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,410
But we'll take care of him.

81
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:50,382
Isn't your cabinet looking
for a new Chief of Army Staff?

82
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:55,595
I have no problem
accepting that offer.

83
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:08,608
Srikant!

84
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:10,360
Srikant!

85
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,737
Srikant!

86
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:14,364
You were supposed to tell
me when you got back.

87
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,450
Talk softly.

88
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:21,288
Fuck!

89
00:10:22,831 --> 00:10:24,207
-Sorry.
-What happened?

90
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,417
Any leads?

91
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,046
We're combing through
Delhi for Moosa.

92
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,506
What about your
door-to-door search?

93
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,092
Nothing. Mostly false alarms.

94
00:10:35,552 --> 00:10:37,763
We don't have any leads.

95
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,517
And we're running out of time.

96
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:45,812
Relax, Srikant.
We'll figure it out.

97
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,191
I just hope that...

98
00:10:49,941 --> 00:10:52,819
they pressure General Ansari.

99
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:04,331
Good shot, Major.

100
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,464
Major Sameer,
please come with us.

101
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:13,924
Who the hell are you?

102
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,389
-Don't you know who I am?
-Of course.

103
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:22,516
Let me guess.

104
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:24,768
1/11 Infantry.

105
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,355
Why did you leave the PM unsecured?

106
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:30,273
-Cuff him.
-How dare you!

107
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,817
Do you know what you're doing?

108
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:32,776
Mask him.

109
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:37,072
I'll make sure you're
punished for this.

110
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,199
Let go of me, you bastards!

111
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,202
You cannot just barge
into somebody's house

112
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,662
and start asking questions.

113
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,872
You should've filed a notice first.

114
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:48,417
Ma'am, I am an undercover officer.

115
00:11:49,876 --> 00:11:51,545
We don't file notices.

116
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:54,756
We came to know
through our network...

117
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,676
that Kareem sent her a message

118
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,387
-when...
-He was murdered.

119
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:05,225
That, we don't know.

120
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,436
All we know that
he sent you a message.

121
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,354
You might want to tell us about it.

122
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,773
-It'd be good for you.
-Is that a threat?

123
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:13,859
Are you threatening her?

124
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:16,361
Ma'am, you're
misunderstanding me.

125
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,156
The gang Kareem worked for,

126
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,824
cannot be trusted.
They--

127
00:12:20,907 --> 00:12:23,076
Kareem was never a part of a gang.

128
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,328
You murdered him!

129
00:12:25,704 --> 00:12:28,748
Now you're covering
up by blaming him.

130
00:12:28,874 --> 00:12:30,667
When you returned his belongings

131
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,294
his phone was missing.

132
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:33,503
Where is it?

133
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,713
Where is his phone?

134
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:36,673
How would I know?

135
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:41,136
It must be with the
people he was working for.

136
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:42,053
Please!

137
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:45,098
Whatever you want to say,
please say it in court.

138
00:12:45,223 --> 00:12:46,975
We are suing all of you.

139
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,518
ATS, Mumbai Police.

140
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:50,395
Ma'am! That's...

141
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:52,355
Don't do that.

142
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:55,817
We're just doing our duty.

143
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,153
We're just trying to help you.

144
00:12:58,820 --> 00:12:59,905
You seeâ€¦

145
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:04,159
if you co-operate,
we have a chance...

146
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,078
to find out why he died.

147
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:09,748
I didn't get any text from him.

148
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,960
Not when he was alive.

149
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,171
What do you mean?

150
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:19,007
Did you get a text after he died?

151
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,637
-Did he?
-Jonali, no need to answer him. Okay?

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,096
One minute, ma'am.

153
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,015
What was the message?

154
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:30,852
It was only one word.

155
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,312
What was it?

156
00:13:34,105 --> 00:13:35,649
-Ink.
-Ink?

157
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,443
Correct.

158
00:13:38,902 --> 00:13:39,986
Ink.

159
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:43,156
Is that a code word you used?

160
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,283
What does it mean?

161
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,827
I wish I knew.

162
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:50,830
You know it.
That's why he sent it to you.

163
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:52,666
Think.

164
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:54,960
What could it possibly mean?

165
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,755
-Think.
-She just said she doesn't know.

166
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,007
Will her answer change if
you keep pestering her?

167
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,176
She'll tell you when
she figures it out.

168
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,344
Fine?

169
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,806
Thank you.

170
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,141
Let's go.

171
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,687
When you figure out what
it means, let us know.

172
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,067
Come. Let's have some tea.

173
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,574
How's your therapy progressing, Jonali?

174
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,536
The counselor said...

175
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:32,539
I can stop taking anxiety
pills after three weeks.

176
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:33,915
Don't be scared.

177
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,459
They'll use everything against us.

178
00:14:36,626 --> 00:14:38,420
Power, money, politics.

179
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,630
But you have to be strong. Okay?

180
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:45,885
But I'm sure Kareem was trying
to tell me something.

181
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,012
What do you mean?

182
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:48,179
Look at this.

183
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,725
-What could it mean?
-I don't know.

184
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,812
Kareem had once
thrown ink at a politician.

185
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:59,816
That's all that I can
gather from "ink."

186
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,943
But what could it possibly mean?

187
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:03,820
Don't worry, we'll find out.

188
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:09,928
Hello, sir. Good evening.

189
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:12,764
-The usual one, sir?
-Yes.

190
00:16:28,363 --> 00:16:29,698
Send him another drink.

191
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:31,700
-Sure, sir.
-On my behalf.

192
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,999
I didn't order this.

193
00:17:09,946 --> 00:17:11,406
It's a decent hotel.

194
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,658
Do you come here often?

195
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,619
Listen...

196
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:18,872
Let's exchange numbers.

197
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,206
We can plan something again.

198
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:23,001
Why? Once is enough!

199
00:17:23,126 --> 00:17:24,753
What if I want to meet you again?

200
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,463
If we're destined to...

201
00:17:26,755 --> 00:17:28,214
we'll certainly meet again.

202
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,482
Hi, sweetie.
Yes, I am on my way.

203
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:47,692
Of course, I was at work.

204
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,944
We have to do those extra
shifts these days.

205
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,529
There's a lot of work.

206
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,031
Is the little one asleep?

207
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,366
Oh, well...

208
00:17:55,617 --> 00:17:58,036
I wanted to come play with him.

209
00:17:58,495 --> 00:17:59,579
Never mind.

210
00:17:59,662 --> 00:18:01,039
I'm coming.

211
00:18:09,923 --> 00:18:12,258
I've sent you all the
videos on WhatsApp.

212
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:14,636
Fine.

213
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,429
Delete them from your phone.

214
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:26,314
I hope we are even now.

215
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:28,566
Yes.

216
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,069
And not a word about
this to anybody.

217
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,320
-Got it?
-Yes.

218
00:18:32,403 --> 00:18:33,613
Leave.

219
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,084
Good job.

220
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:47,544
Thank you, bhai.

221
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:49,462
WhatsApp it to me.

222
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:50,630
Sure.

223
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,258
Is the team ready?

224
00:18:53,508 --> 00:18:55,009
Yes. Everything is ready...

225
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,512
at Sanjay Colony.

226
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,472
Don't do anythingâ€¦

227
00:19:00,265 --> 00:19:01,599
until I give the word.

228
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:02,767
Got it.

229
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:03,685
Go home.

230
00:19:03,768 --> 00:19:05,019
-Khuda hafiz. 
 -Khuda hafiz.

231
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,609
We need to save this country!

232
00:19:11,734 --> 00:19:13,361
We need to protect our religion!

233
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,864
Sir, why are you spreadingÂ hatred?

234
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,116
-WhoÂ said that? 
 -Hey, move aside.

235
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,033
What did you say?

236
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,494
Sir, don't you think 
 you're spreading hatred?

237
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:23,454
TheÂ truthÂ isÂ alwaysÂ bitter,Â son.

238
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,039
To stay in this country--

239
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:31,045
Kareem had written
"Ink" in the message.

240
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:35,008
Maybe he was trying to
tell me something about this incident.

241
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:36,467
This was the first time

242
00:19:36,551 --> 00:19:38,928
Kareem raised his voice
against the system.

243
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:42,015
He started writing his
blog after this incident.

244
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,975
How is that related to this text?

245
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,270
Maybe he was doing something
similar this time.

246
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:50,064
You mean another ink attack?

247
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:53,234
Ink attack or maybe
something else like that.

248
00:19:54,861 --> 00:19:57,864
I refuse to believe that
he could ever kill anybody.

249
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,032
He was not a terrorist.

250
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:01,284
Let's assume you're right about this.

251
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:03,286
But how do we prove it?

252
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:06,122
The police returned all his belongings...

253
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,250
except for his bodycam.

254
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,419
I am sure his
bodycam was with him.

255
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:14,505
Because that's the whole point
of pulling off a stunt like this.

256
00:20:15,173 --> 00:20:18,509
You mean Kareem wanted
you to look for the camera?

257
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,387
What else could it possibly mean?

258
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:22,555
You said it yourself.

259
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:24,682
Kareem couldn't tell me everything.

260
00:20:24,933 --> 00:20:28,144
He knew the police would
check all his stuff.

261
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:32,857
Maybe that's why he sent me
something only I could understand.

262
00:20:34,275 --> 00:20:35,151
Makes sense.

263
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:37,070
I think we should
look for the camera.

264
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,944
After all the things
I did for my country...

265
00:21:18,528 --> 00:21:19,988
this my reward?

266
00:21:20,071 --> 00:21:22,782
This is not for what you
did for your country.

267
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,828
It's for what you were
going to do to your country.

268
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:29,205
Tell me.

269
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,915
Where is the nerve gas?

270
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:35,503
What are you talking about?

271
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,046
I don't understand.

272
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:38,673
Listen to me carefully.

273
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,967
We know everything.

274
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:44,012
I'll give you one more chance

275
00:21:44,262 --> 00:21:45,888
to save yourself.

276
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,517
It doesn't matter if a million lives
like mine

277
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,019
are sacrificed for my Pakistan.

278
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:55,523
If you think you'll
succeed, you're wrong.

279
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:03,406
Here, look at this.

280
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,245
You used to follow his orders, right?

281
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:14,208
General Ansari has joined
the PM and deserted you.

282
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,753
If you continue to be stubborn...

283
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:18,755
you will die.

284
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:20,965
And that too for an infidel

285
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,802
who doesn't care about anybody
but himself.

286
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,601
Sameer, there's still time.

287
00:22:32,185 --> 00:22:33,853
Give us what we want.

288
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:36,522
We'll close the matter.

289
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:48,159
Sir.

290
00:22:48,409 --> 00:22:51,204
Srikant, I got a call from 
 Khursheed in Islamabad.

291
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:53,873
We have the location 
 coordinates of the nerve gas.

292
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:58,169
Sajid will be transporting them.

293
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,379
We need to move in now.

294
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,672
Okay, sir.

295
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,675
We have inputs from Intelligence.

296
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,304
Our target will move the
stock from this location.

297
00:23:15,895 --> 00:23:18,022
The target is
a highly motivated individual.

298
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,566
He has extensive training in IEDs.

299
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:21,943
As far as I know

300
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:24,320
he has complete support
of Basharat and the locals.

301
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,739
Our communication units
will launch drones

302
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,116
to get their exact locations.

303
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:29,909
If they'd still be in the village

304
00:23:29,992 --> 00:23:31,410
we'll attack them there.

305
00:23:31,494 --> 00:23:32,912
If they leave the village

306
00:23:32,995 --> 00:23:34,914
then I'll be stationed
with Unit Alpha here.

307
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:36,791
Unit Bravo will be here on standby

308
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,626
and Unit Charlie will be here.

309
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:40,962
Once they take the route on the mountain

310
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,964
there's no other way out.

311
00:23:43,297 --> 00:23:44,882
We'll have to surround them on both sides.

312
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,426
Nobody fires at the
truck without my orders.

313
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,803
-Am I clear?
-Yes, sir.

314
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:50,138
-Am I clear?
-Yes, sir!

315
00:23:50,263 --> 00:23:51,097
Good.

316
00:24:00,648 --> 00:24:02,108
Catch it!

317
00:24:05,153 --> 00:24:06,445
Go, get it.

318
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:14,370
Hurry up!

319
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,330
Throw it!

320
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:22,545
What are you looking for?
Did you lose something?

321
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,839
Nothing. Run along.

322
00:24:26,048 --> 00:24:27,258
Listen.

323
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,760
Do you play here every day?

324
00:24:31,429 --> 00:24:33,222
Did you find something here?

325
00:24:33,431 --> 00:24:34,557
Anything at all?

326
00:24:34,932 --> 00:24:36,642
Something secret?

327
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:39,103
Yes, something secret.

328
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,813
No, I didn't find anything.

329
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,150
Okay, go play.

330
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,838
You're doing Allah's work, sir.

331
00:25:05,963 --> 00:25:10,593
These infidels won't find a place even
in hell for treating you like this.

332
00:25:10,927 --> 00:25:13,596
God will punish them.

333
00:25:14,555 --> 00:25:16,766
Can I be of any help to you?

334
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:34,200
Basharat?

335
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:35,243
Yes, brother.

336
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:37,703
Tell the groom right away
that he shouldn't go collect the turban.

337
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,080
Brother...

338
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,624
-has the wedding been called off?
 -No.

339
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,669
The wedding will take place
on the decided date.

340
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:46,629
Now listen carefully.

341
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,423
Tell the groom right away to go to Delhi

342
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,050
and meet his elder brother.

343
00:25:51,133 --> 00:25:53,135
Meet his Chettan.

344
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,012
He has chosen another girl for him.

345
00:25:55,221 --> 00:25:56,722
He'll explain everything.

346
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,062
Thank you.

347
00:26:07,316 --> 00:26:08,526
Farooq!

348
00:26:10,278 --> 00:26:11,821
-We have to stop Sajid.
-Now?

349
00:26:12,405 --> 00:26:14,949
Get all the boys.

350
00:26:15,366 --> 00:26:18,202
Carry the weapons with you.

351
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:20,579
Basheer, Farooq, Ashraf, let's go!

352
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,248
Quick!

353
00:26:39,390 --> 00:26:41,809
The number you're 
 trying to call is currently--

354
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:42,935
Damn!

355
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:45,438
Faster!

356
00:26:50,443 --> 00:26:52,403
That's him! I can see him!

357
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,331
They are following us.

358
00:27:05,916 --> 00:27:07,168
Drive faster.

359
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,590
He doesn't know it's me.

360
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:14,592
Sajid, stop!

361
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,260
Is that Basharat?

362
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,555
What does he want?

363
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,560
Sajid!

364
00:27:24,852 --> 00:27:25,936
Stop.

365
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:28,981
Sajid, stop the vehicle!

366
00:27:33,235 --> 00:27:35,279
Why did you stop us?
What's going on?

367
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,866
We have orders that the groom
must not leave the village.

368
00:27:38,949 --> 00:27:40,326
What nonsense!

369
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:42,161
The mission has
been compromised.

370
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:45,664
I was told that the mission
should be finished at any cost.

371
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,833
-So, what happened suddenly?
-I don't know.

372
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,377
We have direct orders
from Major Sameer.

373
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,253
You can shove the orders
up a donkey's ass.

374
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,755
I am taking the truck--

375
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,138
Shoot.

376
00:28:01,931 --> 00:28:03,599
In fact, shoot me in the back.

377
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:05,893
Because that's what cowards do.

378
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,812
I've been entrusted
with this mission...

379
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:09,855
and I shall complete it.

380
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:11,107
Sajid...

381
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:13,192
now is not the time for your nonsense.

382
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:16,320
Major Sameer has asked you to
go to Delhi and meet Chettan.

383
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,822
Chettan?

384
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,365
Damn you mother...

385
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:25,162
Target engaged.
Orders, please.

386
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,081
-Engage on target. 
-Fire!

387
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,582
They're firing!

388
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,532
Do not shoot at the truck!

389
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:34,732
Attention all units.
This is Alpha.

390
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:37,234
The target is on the move. 
 He's heading towards you.

391
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:38,194
Engage to capture.

392
00:29:38,277 --> 00:29:39,778
I repeat, engage to capture. Over.

393
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:42,156
-Copy.
-Alert! The target is coming!

394
00:30:07,515 --> 00:30:08,682
Motherfucker!

395
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:10,059
Send out a red alert.

396
00:30:10,351 --> 00:30:13,604
Call as many fire brigades
and ambulances as you can.

397
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:32,581
Alpha to Bravo.

398
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:34,250
-The target is approaching you.
-Copy.

399
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:36,877
Alert!
Do not shoot the truck!

400
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:42,216
Why have they put nails over there?

401
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:45,511
Get rid of them!
The truck might crash!

402
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,099
Damn it, the truck will crash!

403
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,183
Get rid of the nails!

404
00:30:51,267 --> 00:30:52,726
Get rid of the nails!

405
00:30:52,893 --> 00:30:54,979
Hurry up!

406
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:56,438
Yes, sir.

407
00:31:00,317 --> 00:31:01,402
Fuck!

408
00:31:06,448 --> 00:31:08,158
We need the masks now!
Get the masks!

409
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:09,910
-Masks!
-Get the masks!

410
00:31:13,789 --> 00:31:15,040
Get down!

411
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:57,958
No leakage detected. 
 All canisters are intact.

412
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,628
Thank God!

413
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,715
If their plan worked...

414
00:32:06,133 --> 00:32:07,885
it would have been a disaster.

415
00:32:09,136 --> 00:32:11,597
I just wish that
bastard was captured!

416
00:32:11,722 --> 00:32:14,642
Yes, but at least
Mission Zulfiqar is over.

417
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:25,235
Thank you.

418
00:32:37,206 --> 00:32:38,207
Since the time you've been here,

419
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,501
you've been messing your health up.

420
00:32:40,584 --> 00:32:42,961
You always have a drink
or a cigarette in your hand.

421
00:32:44,213 --> 00:32:45,923
How else can one tackle stress?

422
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:47,424
There are other ways.

423
00:32:47,508 --> 00:32:49,343
You can't keep smoking just
because your wife's not here.

424
00:32:49,426 --> 00:32:50,552
Come on.

425
00:32:51,095 --> 00:32:52,888
What's gotten into you?

426
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:57,643
Fuck, yeah!

427
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,436
I'm going to miss you.

428
00:33:05,609 --> 00:33:07,111
-Me too--
-Don't force yourself.

429
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:10,030
You don't have to say it
just because I did.

430
00:33:10,114 --> 00:33:11,365
Now go.

431
00:33:11,573 --> 00:33:13,033
-Bye.
-Bye.

432
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:14,993
Listen...

433
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,204
I couldn't meet your husband.

434
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:20,916
What?

435
00:33:21,208 --> 00:33:24,128
How can you?
I am not married.

436
00:33:27,506 --> 00:33:29,133
I hope it's not because of me.

437
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,761
You really think too much
of yourself, Srikant!

438
00:33:32,845 --> 00:33:33,887
Now go.

439
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:36,014
-Go!
-Okay.

440
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,851
So Ms. Saloni is still Ms. Saloni?

441
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:41,103
There's something going on.
On and off.

442
00:33:41,854 --> 00:33:42,855
Who is he?

443
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,231
Bye.

444
00:33:45,649 --> 00:33:46,734
Bye.

445
00:33:55,993 --> 00:33:57,703
-Major Vikram?
-Bye!

446
00:34:41,830 --> 00:34:42,998
Moosa!

447
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,958
It's been ages!

448
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:48,545
Yes, it's been a long time.

449
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:58,055
Come in.

450
00:35:00,182 --> 00:35:02,392
Faizan trusted me.

451
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,312
He entrusted me with this mission.

452
00:35:07,147 --> 00:35:08,857
I let him down.

453
00:35:10,901 --> 00:35:12,319
I don't know how...

454
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,446
I'll be able to face him.

455
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,114
Faizan was captured.

456
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,741
What happened?

457
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,702
-Is he a martyr now?
-He's currently in American custody.

458
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:24,873
And Major Sameer was arrested
by the Pakistani Army.

459
00:35:28,961 --> 00:35:31,797
And General Ansari turned
out to be a traitor.

460
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:38,136
Zulfiqar is over.

461
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,889
Everything's over!

462
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,811
Zulfiqar is not over yet.

463
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,150
It's not over.

464
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:54,820
There is a Plan B.
