00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,340
"Kaaleen bhaiya"

3
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:39,420
"King of Mirzapur"

4
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,380
So, motherfucker, I
guess that makes me a... ?

5
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:51,180
Prince.

6
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:57,700
Prince.

7
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:18,460
Here you go, Munna bhaiya.

8
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,420
Got it for free!

9
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,340
I just had to mention
Kaaleen bhaiya's name.

10
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:28,140
Leeching off someone else's power...

11
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,060
... won't get you very far, Compounder.

12
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,020
Get in, take the beer.

13
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,660
Oh, man!

14
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:39,740
Look at them wagging their
fucking asses, the bloody cunts.

15
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:42,740
Let's fix this.

16
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,500
Let's go, Compounder.

17
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:38,820
Hey there, take it
easy. Take it easy, pal.

18
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,300
Who are you, man?

19
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:47,380
- I'll tell you...
- Fuck!

20
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,300
Come on, asshole. Dance.

21
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,676
Do you know the Hrithik
Roshan step? Do it.

22
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,060
Go on. Like this.

23
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,580
Whoa! Look at that!

24
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,420
Next, next, next, which one next?

25
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,060
- Cobra dance!
- Yes, cobra dance!

26
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,316
- Now, do the lightning!
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!

27
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:12,460
Fly the kite!

28
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:08,380
Fixed them proper.

29
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:38,260
Greetings Kaaleen bhaiya.

30
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,660
Maqbool...

31
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,700
Yes?

32
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,220
Lala has kept his word.

33
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:27,260
The dark chocolate is top-notch,
it'll give an effective high.

34
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,740
Increase our carpet production.

35
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,020
- Yes sir.
- And what about the guns?

36
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,620
Ready to ship.

37
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,180
He's here, Bhaiyaji is here.

38
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,940
Greetings, sir.

39
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:48,500
Could I get a minute
with Kaaleen bhaiya?

40
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,540
He's our guy from Tulsi Chowk.

41
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:57,500
Sir, I'm one of your gun distributors.

42
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,180
This man bought a homespun
gun from me. The gun...

43
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,260
Sir! I squeezed the trigger,
and it blew up in my hand.

44
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,580
So what, you decided to land
up on my doorstep, motherfucker?

45
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:15,060
No, sir! I didn't want
to, but he insisted.

46
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,820
Didn't you test it before buying it?

47
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,500
How much did you pay for it?

48
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,300
Er... 1500.

49
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,660
What do you expect for
1500? A fucking AK-47?

50
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:37,140
Maqbool, give him another one.

51
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:39,340
Give him a loaded one.

52
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Take it.

53
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,820
Well? Try it.

54
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,700
Go ahead.

55
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:05,780
Sir, I am right-handed.

56
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:09,460
You were. Now, you're left-handed.

57
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,421
You'll be eating and wiping your ass

58
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:13,516
with that one hand
the rest of your life.

59
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,580
Go on, try it.

60
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,980
You, come here.

61
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,860
Yes, sir?

62
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:51,300
Here. Take him to the hospital.

63
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:02,940
Maqbool, we have to do
something about these guns.

64
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,700
It's bad for business.

65
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:23,900
Friends, who will let a new
day dawn upon your lives?

66
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:29,300
Who will liberate Gajjumal College
from Munna Tripathi's terrorism?

67
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,180
Who will usher in peace and prosperity?

68
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:36,140
I will! Yes, me... Deepu Singh!

69
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,140
Vote for me as your President!

70
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:44,620
Create a better future for
your college and yourselves!

71
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:08,020
Your wrists are strong enough,
Guddu bhaiya. Now study a bit too.

72
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,700
Oi, Mr Hulk.

73
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:17,140
Stand up! What is the
next journal entry?

74
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,420
On your feet, boy!

75
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:38,380
This gorilla-like body that you're
building, it complements your mind.

76
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,140
Both thick.

77
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,180
You've been flunking
for the past 2 years.

78
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:48,140
Is this your personal 5-year plan?

79
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,820
Sit down. Thickhead.

80
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,500
What are you laughing about?

81
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,260
He just called me a dickhead.

82
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,516
I'm going to pound his
face into the ground.

83
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,700
Not dickhead, he's
calling you a thickhead.

84
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,420
It's 'Th', not 'D'.

85
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:08,900
Thickhead as in... stupid. Slow-witted.

86
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh, then it's alright.

87
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:17,380
If I had any sense, I wouldn't
have rolled down into your class.

88
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,660
Yeah, that's why I keep
saying, study a little.

89
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,460
Studying won't do fuckall for me, Bablu.

90
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:24,420
The reservation quota kids will
take away all the seats, anyway.

91
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,252
You know my plan, bro.

92
00:12:26,253 --> 00:12:28,460
I'm going to win the Mr
Purvanchal title this year.

93
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,780
Fifty-one grand prize money.

94
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,420
Kaaleen bhaiya is the sponsor.

95
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,300
He's gonna hand me the trophy himself.

96
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,020
Right.

97
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,020
Just wait and watch.

98
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:45,860
Morning, morning!

99
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,626
If you want to remove
tyranny from this college,

100
00:12:47,627 --> 00:12:49,500
then give me your vote.

101
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,060
Deepu Singh! Remember the name!

102
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,380
Vote for Deepu Singh.

103
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,340
Hey! Deepu bro!

104
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:03,820
Hey! Well, go after
him. Get the bastard.

105
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,620
Oi! Stop!

106
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:09,060
Get him. Get him!

107
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:10,660
Making us run in the morning.

108
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,340
Motherfucker.

109
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:18,500
Giving us the damn college tour.

110
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:24,540
Hey, labcoat! Where did he go?

111
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,580
Are you gonna tell us or should
I teach you some chemistry?

112
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,100
Get the fucker!

113
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,660
Hit me with the bottle, will you?

114
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,780
Stop running!

115
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:39,380
Shat your pants, Mr Politician?

116
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:44,660
Shit!

117
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,900
Go on. Right inside.

118
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,940
Bitch is making us work
off that big breakfast.

119
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,700
Good morning, sir.

120
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:08,980
Well, asshole?

121
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,140
Why are y'all turning around?

122
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,636
Is there a movie playing back there?

123
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:15,980
- Solve the problem.
- Bablu, did you see that?

124
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,940
The way Munna bhaiya
made the fucker run.

125
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:20,140
Drop it. Drop it.

126
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,580
How many times have I told you?

127
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:26,180
You nerdy bookworms need
to stay out of politics.

128
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,900
Study hard, get a government job.

129
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,340
Run the nation.

130
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,020
But no, you've got bloody ants
crawling up your ass crack.

131
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,700
Fuckface.

132
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:39,300
But, no! You want to contest
elections, canvass support!

133
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,980
Oi, fucker.

134
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,820
Come on, get up.

135
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:55,580
Do you know who I am? Munna Tripathi.

136
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,980
King of Gajjumal College.

137
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:03,620
So fucker, when I stand for
elections, the result is a given.

138
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,300
Right?

139
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,140
It's not hard to understand.

140
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:10,300
Hmm... Scissor him up.

141
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,540
No, bhaiya!

142
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,420
- Should I take the penalty?
- Yes, bhaiyaji.

143
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:18,540
What a goal!

144
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,140
Thus, both of Khanna's
FDs had to be cracked open.

145
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,700
You! Evening tea and
snacks in the canteen.

146
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:30,180
Put it on my tab.

147
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,900
Munna bhaiya! Make it eggs. Fifty.

148
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,140
He wants to be the Great Khali.

149
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,060
You can have the tea then, sir.

150
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,460
- Let's go.
- Why'd you trip up Deepu Singh?

151
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:47,100
Didn't you see how
impressed Munna bhaiya was?

152
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,180
What are you doing?

153
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:59,700
You wear such tight leggings!
Your gait is hypnotizing.

154
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,690
No wonder guys end up
taking the town tour

155
00:16:01,691 --> 00:16:03,020
when they're trailing after you.

156
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,020
Have a little shame, Sweety.

157
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,740
Oh, around you as well?

158
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:11,303
But, seriously, when a
guy has his eyes on you,

159
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:14,220
doesn't that make you strut?

160
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Oh, is that so?

161
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:18,420
Then how come you haven't taken
my brother out on a date yet?

162
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:21,700
Why should I take him
out? Am I the man or is he?

163
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,516
Every date in the
calendar will run out...

164
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,556
... but your brother will never
have the guts to ask me out.

165
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,980
He shits bricks when I'm around.

166
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,580
Watch.

167
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,260
You've built a great body.

168
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:45,580
Now, if anyone were to harass me,
you'd come to my rescue, right?

169
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:48,060
Sure, 'coz he's got
nothing better to do.

170
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,580
"Saving" the likes of you.

171
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,780
Why don't you hire a bodyguard?

172
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,940
Will you be my bodyguard?

173
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,300
Show me. Show me them boulders.

174
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,500
Oh, come on! Blow 'em
up, like a balloon.

175
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:29,820
Huh! Don't ever touch me...

176
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,980
... without my permission.

177
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,900
If I tell my father, you'll
be beaten black and blue.

178
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,820
You know he's a policeman, right?

179
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:41,100
It'll be the third degree for you.

180
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,500
Your ass will be so sore, you
won't be able to sit for a week.

181
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,860
Oww... let me go.

182
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:49,620
Just wait till we get home.

183
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,180
If you like Guddu bhaiya, tell him.

184
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:55,180
If not, move on. Don't mess around.

185
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,460
If a girl is beautiful,
she can do what she wants.

186
00:17:59,820 --> 00:18:02,500
I am beautiful, aren't I?

187
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,020
Bye.

188
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:21,060
Bye.

189
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,340
Got a match, Mr Pandit?

190
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,460
I don't smoke.

191
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,980
Just wanted to clean my
ear. I don't smoke either.

192
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,820
When's the hearing?

193
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:58,220
In ten minutes.

194
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,540
This case, it's Mr Yadav's man.

195
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,100
I need you to take it easy in court

196
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,100
and ensure a 'not guilty' verdict.

197
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,180
Not guilty.

198
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:24,220
Get up, bastard.

199
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:28,140
Motherfucker, this is a courthouse.

200
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:31,620
You've made a mockery of it. Cocksucker!

201
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:37,740
Whoreshit! Get out!

202
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,900
Asshole!

203
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,020
Ramakant!

204
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,860
Mr Pandit! Let him go!

205
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,700
He's shitting bricks.

206
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,460
Don't show your face here ever again!

207
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:48,340
Mr Pandit, Mr Pandit! Let him go!

208
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,980
Listen to me.

209
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:52,100
C'mon, he's shitting bricks. Let him go.

210
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,580
They're termites, Judge.

211
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,100
They've destroyed the bloody town.

212
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,460
What can you do, Mr Pandit?

213
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:57,860
Go, man, go.

214
00:19:58,620 --> 00:19:59,660
You watch out.

215
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,420
Get lost, motherfucker.

216
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,100
Should I throw you in lockup?

217
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Get out!

218
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:08,420
Come, let's go in.

219
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,380
I'm the groom's uncle, and this is...

220
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:14,780
My brother-in-law, the groom's father.

221
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:18,940
Sir, you will take the case, right?

222
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,500
Three lawyers have already refused.

223
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
May I see the file?

224
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,260
Here.

225
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:37,220
This is the wedding
procession. And this...

226
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:41,020
This boy fired the gun. I witnessed it.

227
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:44,740
This boy fired the gun?

228
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:49,460
I'm definitely taking the case.

229
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:53,460
Leave behind the file, I'll study it.

230
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,620
Sir... You won't change
your mind later, right?

231
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,300
Don't worry about me.

232
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,980
Are you sure you won't
change your mind later?

233
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:10,300
East or west, Munna bhaiya is the best!

234
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:12,620
You guys already know me.

235
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,300
Phoolchand Tripathi, aka Munna.

236
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,980
Who's the best?

237
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,860
Munna bhaiya!

238
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,300
- Can I say something?
- Yeah?

239
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,060
No offence, but Phoolchand
Tripathi is a pretty lame name.

240
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:31,660
Motherfucker, don't make me pulverize
your nose. Shut up and cheer.

241
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:38,140
East or west! Munna bhaiya's the best!

242
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:41,060
Long live Munna bhaiya!

243
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,860
That guy. That's Mr Purvanchal.

244
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:47,260
- Who?
- That guy, the one who's flexing.

245
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,660
This year, I'll win the contest.

246
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:53,340
And then I'll win Mr Uttar Pradesh;

247
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,060
and finally Mr India.

248
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,694
My face will be on billboards everywhere

249
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,236
and that's when I'll
start up 'Guddu Gym'.

250
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:00,980
Thuggery has increased in college.

251
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:03,980
Students are getting beaten up in class.

252
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:05,636
This won't be allowed
to go on any longer.

253
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:08,980
No more, no more! Hooliganism, no more.

254
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,340
Munna bhaiya's riding the gravy train.

255
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,940
Thrash anybody, screw
with the teacher. Huh?

256
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,140
Girls constantly throwing
themselves at him...

257
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:21,140
... and that sexy ride.

258
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:25,740
When you gun it to 100, it
feels like a million bucks.

259
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,060
Life oughta be lived like this!

260
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:35,540
Otherwise, hell, even the
hair on your balls is alive.

261
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:42,700
Motherfucking son of a bitch.

262
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:47,380
If we had a Vespa, then this
fucking bullshit wouldn't happen.

263
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,420
Hey! Guddu bhaiya, why
are you freaking out?

264
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,796
It's just a chain that's fallen off!

265
00:22:57,820 --> 00:23:01,540
Yeah, and what about my pride
that's ground to dust? Mother...

266
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,900
Guddu bhaiya, stop!
Enough! Enough, enough!

267
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,740
You've smashed the cycle
to pieces, bro. Enough!

268
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,660
Did you speak to Papa again
about going to Lucknow?

269
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
What are you shaking your head for?

270
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:24,060
Why didn't you, idiot?

271
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:27,380
Just fucking go to Lucknow and
finish your Civil Services coaching!

272
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,540
You're smart.

273
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:31,220
You'll pass with flying colors.

274
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,260
I'll convince Papa.

275
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,780
Don't bother.

276
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,180
He'll just say that this is
a waste of time and money.

277
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:50,860
Anyway, going to Lucknow
won't guarantee my selection.

278
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,780
I can prepare for it
right here in Mirzapur too.

279
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,340
And if that doesn't work out, I
can always apply to the local bank.

280
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,580
This is what I mean!

281
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:04,180
A middle-class man isn't
a man, he's a bloody moron.

282
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,331
No matter how fucking talented you are,

283
00:24:06,332 --> 00:24:08,860
you'll never get out of
this shitty little town.

284
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,660
You've hit the nail on the head, bro.

285
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,420
Now look at me...

286
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,900
I wanted to participate in Indian Idol.

287
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,476
And here I am, repairing punctures.

288
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,956
Asshole, stop running your yap hole,
I'll ream your mother, cuntlicker.

289
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,380
How much do I have to pay?

290
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:23,500
Son of a bitch.

291
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:35,140
Tripathi Square, Tripathi's town.

292
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:39,780
This is what life in
Mirzapur should be like.

293
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,780
Well, keep pedaling.

294
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:48,780
[Akhandanand Tripathi]

295
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,020
Shift a little.

296
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:30,980
The man is always on top.

297
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,060
Then get it right.

298
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:39,100
I'm... about to come.

299
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,580
Please, just a little longer.

300
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,020
Sweet Lord.

301
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:12,940
What?

302
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,540
Did you?

303
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,540
I gave you Viagra, didn't I?

304
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:17,740
Why don't you take it?

305
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,540
You came too soon again.

306
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,900
You can barely get it up anyway.

307
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,340
And then when you do, I'm left
panting like a bitch in heat.

308
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:30,700
In heat, are you?

309
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,460
Shall I leave you in a brothel?

310
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,020
Hmm?

311
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:38,500
You're a bride of the Tripathi dynasty.

312
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,820
Stop behaving like a whore, Beena.

313
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:46,260
I have given you Munna's mother's place.

314
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,420
Be mindful of your status.

315
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,820
If you wanted a mother for Munna bhaiya

316
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,700
you should've gone for someone your age.

317
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,260
Why did you marry someone young?

318
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,700
Wow, look at what steroids can do.

319
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Should I try them?

320
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,340
They have terrible side effects.

321
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:11,580
Don't get into all this.

322
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:19,140
You don't get it, man. No pain, no gain.

323
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:23,340
Bhaiya, let's go get the
cake. Papa will be on his way.

324
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,980
Yeah, Dimpy, gimme 2 minutes.

325
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,700
Apart from the pride, there
are other animals nearby.

326
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:33,800
The lion's gorged on
so much of the hippo

327
00:27:33,801 --> 00:27:36,460
that his stomach is fit to burst.

328
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:41,620
This lioness hasn't held
back from devouring it too.

329
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:43,980
Full pressure.

330
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,860
Yes, Papa.

331
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,060
This is a spotted hyena.

332
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,580
They always attack stealthily.

333
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,716
But what is it that
makes these scavengers

334
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:01,140
the lions' most dreaded enemies?

335
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:30,100
- Vasudha!
- Coming!

336
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:34,220
Did you have lunch? How was the paneer?

337
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:36,860
The judge had it all.

338
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:40,300
- Hmm?
- I had his Chinese cauliflower.

339
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,140
Well, that's just the limit.

340
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:47,060
I put in all this effort for
you, and your judge enjoys it.

341
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,700
How was your day?

342
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,540
Well, you know Mirzapur.

343
00:28:59,140 --> 00:29:04,980
A few days ago, some thugs
killed a groom at his own wedding.

344
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:11,380
The groom's father and uncle
want me to take up their case.

345
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,740
I've said yes.

346
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:29,020
Even if that puts your family in danger?

347
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,780
If you were so passionate
about justice for all

348
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,540
then why did you marry?

349
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:37,260
You should have remained
a bachelor, like Hanuman.

350
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,500
Kept everyone safe.

351
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:43,340
If I wasn't worried about my
family, would I have bought this gun?

352
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,060
How many lawyers do
you know who own a gun?

353
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:50,740
Now don't you start that old
song about your gun again.

354
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:54,140
You ran from pillar to post
for 2 years before you got it.

355
00:29:54,420 --> 00:29:56,740
... when you can get
a homespun gun for 1500.

356
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,220
I'm a lawyer, not a thug.

357
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:04,220
Yes, you're a lawyer, and
marrying you has made me an idiot.

358
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:08,195
If you're done with your
commentary on our marriage,

359
00:30:08,196 --> 00:30:10,140
may I wash my hands, Vasudha ma'am?

360
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:22,180
Come, Munna bhaiya,
I've made mutton today.

361
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,140
No, no, I won't have the mutton.

362
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:29,260
You make it very spicy because
of Papa, I'll have this.

363
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,500
Maqbool, have a bite.

364
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:44,780
It's fine, sir, you go ahead.

365
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,420
You were to have the guns
delivered a couple of days ago.

366
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,700
Did you get it done?

367
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:57,900
Not yet, Papa. I'll do it
tomorrow. Was a bit busy.

368
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,820
Oh? What kept you so busy all day?

369
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,060
Campaigned for the
women's vote in college.

370
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:09,180
Plus, the rival
candidate was being cocky.

371
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:12,140
Got him back into line. It's all good.

372
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Greetings, Bauji.

373
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,700
Hello, sir.

374
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,260
The new stock has arrived, I see.

375
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,580
Grab a gun or two if you want, Gupta.

376
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,820
No, sir. I already have this
gun issued by the UP government

377
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:44,420
Uh, I just came to pay my respects.

378
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:48,540
Am I some deity that
you've come to venerate?

379
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,340
What the fuck has happened that
you couldn't wait the night?

380
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,380
Motherfucker.

381
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,655
Munna bumped off the groom in some
weddinge

382
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,820
and you didn't tell me, Maqbool?

383
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,020
You came here to blabber
about this bullshit?

384
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,340
Was he your son-in-law?

385
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,500
You're a total idiot. Shut up.

386
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,540
And Gupta is just the messenger.

387
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,220
You don't bugger the messenger.

388
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,900
Otherwise, the next bit of
information will never reach you.

389
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,940
Maqbool, how many times have I told you?

390
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,820
Count the bullets before
you give them to him.

391
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:12,020
I'll sort it out, sir.

392
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,236
The fuck you'll sort it out.

393
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,260
Hey!

394
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:18,980
Fuckin' idiot.

395
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:23,540
Which lawyer have they hired?

396
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,740
Ramakant Pandit.

397
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,380
Great, just great.

398
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,780
Son, when will this
tomfoolery of yours end?

399
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,100
Is this how you plan to run this town?

400
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:41,940
Just give me one chance
to run Mirzapur, Papa.

401
00:33:43,820 --> 00:33:45,060
I'll make you proud.

402
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,220
And we're in the gun business.

403
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:51,540
Even if I do take a few extra
bullets, what difference does it make?

404
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,900
If I open a brothel tomorrow...

405
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:59,300
Will you wear a skirt
and start goddamn whoring?

406
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:11,820
We control the business, the
business doesn't control us.

407
00:34:12,140 --> 00:34:14,660
If you keep killing senselessly,
our enemies will grow in number

408
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,540
and you won't even fucking realize.

409
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,700
Don't worry, sir. I'll handle it.

410
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:25,460
Why will you handle it, Maqbool?

411
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,460
Munna shat the bed, he will clean it.

412
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,900
Yeah, I would've handled it anyway.

413
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,020
It's no big deal.

414
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,460
I'll go set that fucking
lawyer straight right now.

415
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,740
Here, I'm putting back
your extra bullets too.

416
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:56,780
Gupta, take some mutton for your family.

417
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,980
- Sir.
- Yes?

418
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,500
Sir, I've heard Rati Shankar's
goons might visit Mirzapur again.

419
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,260
I gave Jaunpur to Rati Shankar.

420
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:15,700
For what joy does he keep
trying to dip his dick here?

421
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,100
Cocksucker.

422
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,860
- Listen.
- Yes?

423
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,100
Here. It's imported.

424
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,276
Your time is good, and this
will continue to remind you.

425
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:27,300
Wear it.

426
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,900
Wear it!

427
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,740
Thank you, sir.

428
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,220
Sahib, mutton.

429
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:36,740
Alright, sir.

430
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:49,180
Father, sometimes I wonder...
What should I do about Munna?

431
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:57,020
Well, what's stopping you
from having another son?

432
00:35:58,020 --> 00:36:00,220
And why were you so late today?

433
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,060
My scooter wasn't working.

434
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,940
Why don't you sell the scooter
and buy a secondhand car, Papa?

435
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:10,980
Why? My scooter works just fine.

436
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,180
It got me home, didn't it?

437
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:15,596
Apart from that, if we
ever have the money...

438
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,380
Yeah, yeah, I know this line by heart.

439
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,260
"If we ever have the money, we'll see".

440
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,580
Life has passed you by, but
we've never seen the money, Papa.

441
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,820
Please, guys, don't start again.

442
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:32,180
Forget it, bro. You're too
scared to even speak up.

443
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,420
Why can't he go to Lucknow?

444
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,340
We just keep worrying about money here.

445
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:50,380
Son, us middle-class folks
have to proceed with caution.

446
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:52,636
Yes, but middle-class folks can
also have dreams, can't they, Papa?

447
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:55,380
Of course! Absolutely, Guddu sir.

448
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:00,180
If they don't flunk the same
class two years in a row.

449
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:02,660
Hmm?

450
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,980
Where has Dimpy gotten to? Dimpy!

451
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,860
- Come!
- Come on, Papa. Stop all this.

452
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,020
What are you doing, kid?

453
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,940
Here's the cake! Cut the cake!

454
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:19,260
What, you want me to blow the
candles out? Like some child?

455
00:37:19,420 --> 00:37:20,820
Go on then.

456
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:22,860
Deep breath, then blow out the candles.

457
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,980
Yes.

458
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:30,300
Happy birthday to you!

459
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,700
It lit up again.

460
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:36,300
Happy birthday dear Papa.

461
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,580
Happy birthday to you!

462
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,996
Alright, stop, that's enough.

463
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,116
Okay, okay, we've stopped, Papa.

464
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:58,860
It's his birthday and you've
smeared my face with cake!

465
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:00,740
Papa's gift!

466
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,420
Yeah, I already got it.

467
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,940
- So, where is it?
- Oh, yeah. Still have to wrap it.

468
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:07,660
Come on, bro!

469
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,900
Hello, Aunty. Is Ramakant Uncle in?

470
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:26,820
- Yes, but... you are?
- Who am I? Yes, who am I?

471
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,780
Very nice house.

472
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:30,620
- Greetings, ma'am.
- Where? Left? Right?

473
00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:31,740
Left, then.

474
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:38,980
Hmm. Where is he? Here he is!

475
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,220
Sit, sit, sit, lawyer sir!
You're embarrassing me!

476
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,060
Greetings, sir.

477
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:01,020
Oh, sorry! I'm Munna, Munna Tripathi.

478
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,940
This... is your daughter?

479
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:29,300
Dimpy, go inside.

480
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,340
Hey, what nonsense is this? Dimpy, wait!

481
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,300
Why will Dimpy go inside, Mr Pandit?

482
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:35,460
That's bullshit. Dimpy, come. Sit here.

483
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,980
Come here. Come, Dimpy. Right here.

484
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:47,980
Okay, that's alright.

485
00:39:49,340 --> 00:39:50,340
Look, Mr Pandit...

486
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,060
We got you a gift, Papa!

487
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:55,220
You won't sell your scooter,
but at least your safety will...

488
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,260
Aunty, how many kids do you have?

489
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,340
Any more upstairs?

490
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,100
Go have a look, bro.

491
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,340
Yes, bhaiyaji.

492
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,620
Oi, move.

493
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:22,020
Hey, Mr Hulk. You're that
accounts class guy, right?

494
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,940
We got you eggs in
the canteen, remember?

495
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:26,500
Yes, Munna bhaiya. You...

496
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,900
Come, come, come. You come along too.

497
00:40:29,020 --> 00:40:30,460
A nice little family gathering.

498
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,420
Great, everybody's here!

499
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:34,940
Your mum's here, your sister's here...

500
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,260
It'll make it easier for me
to ream everybody at once.

501
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,580
Right then, Mr. Pandit.

502
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,340
Getting straight to
the heart of the matter.

503
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,060
That groom who died, I tonked him.

504
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,660
I didn't have any beef with him.
I didn't even know the fucker.

505
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,620
I just get so... into the
dancing, I didn't even realize!

506
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,100
The gun fired... and he
just... kinda toppled over.

507
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:09,340
It was a mistake, Mr Pandit.

508
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,660
Not a crime.

509
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,780
And nobody should get hauled
to court for a mistake, right?

510
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:17,420
Munna bhaiya, what a coincidence!

511
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:19,380
What happened, man?

512
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:21,020
This is our case file!

513
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,100
- Our case file?
- Yes!

514
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
Then, tear it!

515
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:26,860
Go on. Rip it!

516
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:34,060
- Munna bhaiya.
- Yeah, bro?

517
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:35,100
I'll talk to Papa.

518
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:37,180
Yes, yes, absolutely, please do!

519
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:42,020
Papa, whatever case this
is, just let it go...

520
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,460
Did you see that?

521
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,620
How Uncle silenced
him with just a finger?

522
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,380
And you guys thought
he'd be a lightweight.

523
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:05,820
So, the thing is, you won't meet
with that guy's family again.

524
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,380
Understood?

525
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:11,860
And if I didn't understand?
What are you gonna do?

526
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,740
Hmm?

527
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,820
Whoa, Uncle!

528
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,860
We came here thinking
we'd slaughter a lamb...

529
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,380
... but you've turned out
to be a motherfucking lion!

530
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,540
Bravo!

531
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,260
- Listen up...
- Munna!

532
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:38,020
Your daughter's feisty.

533
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:44,700
Marriageable age too.

534
00:42:44,860 --> 00:42:46,460
Hope you've started looking for a boy.

535
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:52,980
If not, send her to me,
I'll douse that fire.

536
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:55,660
- Munna bhaiya!
- What, motherfucker?!

537
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,500
Do you know who his father
is? Akhandanand Tripathi...

538
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:10,460
Your mother's cunt, old man!

539
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,740
Mummy!

540
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:41,460
He's fucked me up.

541
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,260
My ear's gone.

542
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:54,900
Hit him harder!

543
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,820
Hit him.

544
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:19,580
Motherfu...

545
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:25,180
Compounder, bro, my ear!

546
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:26,620
It's burning!

547
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:31,380
Move! Fucking move!

548
00:44:36,460 --> 00:44:38,100
Move, motherfu...

549
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,260
Motherfucker.

550
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,740
Guddu, wait! Guddu,
stop! Let him go! Enough!

551
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,580
Guddu.

552
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,940
Munna, you won't do anything more.

553
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:24,900
Make an enemy out of anyone in
Mirzapur, but not Kaaleen bhaiya.

554
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:29,780
In all the world, could you
only find this one case, Papa?

555
00:46:30,100 --> 00:46:31,100
So, what do I do?

556
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,700
Shall I tell that family
that I shat myself?

557
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:37,980
Papa.

558
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:40,740
Or if you suggest, I'll just retire.

559
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,260
Oh, you'll retire?

560
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:44,502
How about you start
simple and just take a case

561
00:46:44,503 --> 00:46:45,636
where you make some money for a change?

562
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,340
And your family is not
in the line of fire.

563
00:46:47,740 --> 00:46:49,900
But, someone will have to
take cases like this, bhaiya.

564
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,580
You don't make enemies
out of kings, Dimpy.

565
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:55,100
Be practical.

566
00:46:56,260 --> 00:46:58,556
You tell me, how many people can
the two of us beat up together?

567
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:00,060
And will you stop going to college?

568
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,420
Mum had to use the gun today, Papa.

569
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:15,460
Mark my words.

570
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,500
This matter won't end here.

571
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,900
- Hold on.
- Dimpy, Mummy, go inside.

572
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:11,500
- Who is it?
- Just go.

573
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,300
He's right. Dimpy, take her. Get inside.

574
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,540
Kaaleen bhaiya has summoned you.

575
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:00,420
Let's go. I'm ready.

576
00:49:02,300 --> 00:49:03,300
Not you.

577
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:05,900
These two.

578
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,300
You've two minutes.

579
00:49:17,660 --> 00:49:18,660
I'll be in the car.

580
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:32,740
Shall we?

581
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,300
This is my problem.

582
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,220
Why is he involving you boys?

583
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,940
Should've thought of that
before taking the case, Papa.

584
00:49:56,140 --> 00:50:02,020
You... always thrust your hand
into the fire. It will burn.

585
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,140
Kaaleen bhaiya has called us himself.

586
00:50:11,860 --> 00:50:13,300
We don't have an option.

587
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,460
If we don't go, he'll come here.

588
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,500
And if he comes here, Papa...

589
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:45,000
