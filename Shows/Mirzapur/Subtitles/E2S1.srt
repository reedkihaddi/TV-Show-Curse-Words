2
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:45,300
Wait.

3
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:59,900
Did you know Munna was my son?

4
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:07,260
Yes, sir. And we were shitting bricks.

5
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,140
Well then?

6
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,900
Sir, if you were in our position...

7
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,860
perhaps you would've done the same.

8
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,780
If somebody barges into your
house, insults your father...

9
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:25,180
and misbehaves with your
sister, won't you thrash him?

10
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,780
And if he does it again,
we'll beat him up again.

11
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,980
Motherfucker. You'll beat me up?

12
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,800
- Hey!
- Bh-bhaiyaji!

13
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,020
Maqbool.

14
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:11,020
All of Mirzapur's guns...
are under our control.

15
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:16,980
A gun is only controlled
by whoever's holding it.

16
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,740
As you saw earlier today.

17
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,260
Leave him.

18
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:30,980
Munna.

19
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,060
Will you always be there
to save your father?

20
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:06,460
What if you're not there the
next time Munna goes over?

21
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,940
It's risky, no?

22
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:14,175
And what if the next time
Munna bhaiya comes over,

23
00:04:14,176 --> 00:04:16,700
he doesn't return alive?

24
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,020
That's a risk too, Kaaleen bhaiya.

25
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,940
What do you do?

26
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,820
Sir, we're students.

27
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,260
Same college as Munna bhaiya.

28
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,380
And after?

29
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,660
I'm training for Mr Purvanchal.

30
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:53,140
And you?

31
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,100
He's the college topper, in accounts.

32
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,260
Guaranteed a government job.

33
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:04,780
N... no, sir, I haven't
thought ahead yet...

34
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:08,340
... might give the bank PO exam.

35
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,340
Will you work for me?

36
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:41,820
- Sir, we...
- Look, in a bank,

37
00:05:41,821 --> 00:05:44,020
you'll count other people's money.

38
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,300
With me, you'll make your own.

39
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,700
You have 5 minutes to think about it.

40
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,900
What the...

41
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:20,940
Where... where're you going?

42
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,300
Are you listening?

43
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,580
What's your grand plan?

44
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:25,716
You're going there because
you're worried about them, right?

45
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:27,250
And what about me then?

46
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:29,620
I'll be left here worrying
about all three of you!

47
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,940
Am I wrong? Tell me!

48
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,860
It's been 2 hours.

49
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,900
They haven't called once. I'm going.

50
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:39,460
They'll call, Papa. But on my
life, you won't go anywhere.

51
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,300
What are you thinking
so hard about, Bablu?

52
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,220
This decision isn't easy.

53
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,580
Either way, there's a risk.

54
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,620
Bro!

55
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,540
- Yes?
- Get us some boiled eggs, please. A plateful.

56
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,100
Okay.

57
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,900
What risk?

58
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,860
Look at Munna bhaiya,

59
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,060
living the good life.

60
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,620
Everything he has...
we could have it too.

61
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:45,100
Flush with cash...

62
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,420
... people chanting our names,
"Guddu Bhaiya", "Bablu Bhaiya"!

63
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,780
Bablu. Why are you so quiet?

64
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,180
I'm telling you, there's no risk.

65
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,439
We thrashed the shit out
of Kaaleen bhaiya's son,

66
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,700
and he's offering us a job.

67
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,740
He's not an idiot!

68
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,620
He must've seen some potential
in us, that's why he's offering.

69
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,500
And when that potential is used up?

70
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,700
And once we step into this life...

71
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,140
there's no getting out.

72
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:37,340
And what exactly is waiting
for us on the outside? Huh?

73
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:40,580
Just living off other people's scraps.

74
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,580
Let's do it.

75
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,740
If we do this, one thing is for sure...

76
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:10,100
everybody will be safe. Papa,
Dimpy... the whole family.

77
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:13,420
And Munna won't be able
to fuck with us again.

78
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,140
We've laid out a strong
foundation for you.

79
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,460
But if one is not vigilant, even
the strongest house will fall.

80
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:36,580
And why did you harass his sister?

81
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:40,180
Son, this is what petty thugs do.

82
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,740
Have you ever seen me step
out of line with a woman?

83
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:50,340
Remember, a woman's happiness
is always above a man's.

84
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,580
Bitter gourd?

85
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,300
We accept, sir.

86
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,580
Both of you?

87
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,780
Either we're both in, or not at all.

88
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,300
Come, eat.

89
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:27,700
With you?

90
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:30,460
A family dines together, right?

91
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,460
Uncover your plates.

92
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,500
These are for you.

93
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:10,420
The town will work for you,
and you, will work for me.

94
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:19,180
Raja! Serve them dinner.

95
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:35,060
That's enough.

96
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,620
Have some more, please.

97
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,300
You're our guest.

98
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:51,060
When you get home, do
speak with your father.

99
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:02,020
Sir, just a request...

100
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,940
Sitting on that cycle
every day, our ass...

101
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,620
our asses have been flayed.

102
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,860
If we could get a Vespa...

103
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,100
It's yours.

104
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:29,580
When you ride it, people will say,
"There go Kaaleen bhaiya's men."

105
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,340
Put it back in.

106
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:43,780
- Yes, yes.
- Rich people are a different species.

107
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,196
We asked for a Luna, and the
motherfuckers gave us a Bullet.

108
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:51,100
And they fed us too!
And these! Fucking guns!

109
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,220
How many bullets do they have?

110
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:55,500
Should I shoot and see? Huh?

111
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,300
Hey, motherfucker, what're
you doing? Have you gone daft?

112
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,820
That nearly blew my ears out.

113
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:03,315
Dude, folks are shitting themselves here

114
00:14:03,316 --> 00:14:05,420
and you're worried about your ears?

115
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,140
Wh... what are you doing?

116
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,956
You'll wake the whole
neighbourhood, Guddu bhaiya.

117
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,140
What're you doing?

118
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,940
Dude, it's mindblowing! It makes
you feel like a different person.

119
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,140
Here, hold yours!

120
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,300
You put yours back in, and sit behind!

121
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:28,780
Hey! Gud-Guddu bhaiya,
they're guns, not toys!

122
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:30,740
But, I'm having fun playing with them!

123
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,500
Damn it son, switch
this off so we can talk.

124
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:17,820
One day, Mirzapur will
belong to you, Munna.

125
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,220
You want that, don't you?

126
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:25,500
Your nameplate on the jeep...

127
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:28,900
Munna Bhaiya, King of Mirzapur.

128
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,805
Son, when you run this town,

129
00:15:35,806 --> 00:15:38,460
you won't be the one
squeezing the trigger.

130
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,260
You'll need men for that.

131
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,100
Men who'll do as they're told.

132
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,540
And these two will do that.

133
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:52,140
Look, they knew you were my son.

134
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,780
But, did they let that stop them?

135
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,660
They have spunk in their spine.

136
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:04,220
You can see their spunk. And
what about my self-respect?

137
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:06,660
I want my revenge!

138
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:09,060
Munna, what greater
revenge is there than this?

139
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,100
The very people who insulted you...

140
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,420
... in the years to come, they
will work for you, under you.

141
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,620
Today, if we make them faithful...

142
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:21,500
... then tomorrow, they'll
stay faithful to you.

143
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,060
Like Maqbool.

144
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,860
As faithful as he was to Bauji,
he's many times more faithful to me.

145
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,340
Maqbool is family, Papa.

146
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,020
How is he family, son?

147
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:39,820
Have you ever seen him eat with us?

148
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:44,060
But you always ask him.

149
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:48,340
Because I know he'll never
accept. We're not equals.

150
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:51,460
I show him respect by asking, and
he shows me respect by refusing.

151
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,180
Then, why did you let these two sit?

152
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,700
I've just given them
a morsel of respect.

153
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,940
When a man has no hope of
recognition, and he gets it,...

154
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,180
... then his loyalty multiplies tenfold.

155
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:19,580
Remember, Munna, these
people are not our family...

156
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,780
... they're dogs. Loyal.

157
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,260
Maqbool is not my family, you are.

158
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:30,180
You.

159
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,620
Eat.

160
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:02,220
That's why I'm willing to wait for
my inheritance. Because you're family.

161
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,000
See the difference?

162
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,540
This is what I'm talking about.

163
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:33,380
Papa, we called last night,
didn't we? Everything was fine.

164
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,300
Usha, Shahid.

165
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,076
Will you excuse us for a minute?

166
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,140
Sure.

167
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,460
Oh, you called? And that
makes everything okay?

168
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,860
What happened at Akhandanand's?

169
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:03,060
Papa, we've fixed everything.

170
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,380
Fixed everything?

171
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,980
Meaning?

172
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:13,580
We mean... there won't be any
more trouble from Kaaleen bhaiya.

173
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,220
We've joined him, Papa.

174
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,900
And Kaaleen bhaiya himself gave us...

175
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,340
Have you lost it?!

176
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:30,380
Ramakant Pandit's sons,
working for a goon?

177
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,060
Kaaleen bhaiya isn't a goon, he's a don.

178
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:34,220
Shut up! I don't care what he is.

179
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,900
But, we care, Papa!

180
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:42,220
Weren't you worried as hell when
we didn't come home last night?

181
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:46,380
The same way we'll always be
worried about you, Mum and Dimpy.

182
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:50,500
Every morning, every night, until
you return home, safe and sound.

183
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,996
Everything that has happened,
we can't do anything about it.

184
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,100
Just let it go.

185
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:59,220
And anyway, Kaaleen
bhaiya is on our side now.

186
00:19:59,620 --> 00:20:01,020
There'll be no more trouble.

187
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:06,780
And is this what you
came here to tell me?

188
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,340
No.

189
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,620
We came here to say...

190
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,980
let that case go, Papa.

191
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,620
The very message that Munna came to
our house to deliver last night,...

192
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:36,060
that's what the two of you have
come here, to the court, to say!

193
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,460
Aren't you ashamed of talking
to your own father like this?

194
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,420
The two of you can't
possibly be my sons.

195
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,980
Get out of here.

196
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,900
And if anybody has the balls...

197
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:17,700
let them stop me from
taking this case forward!

198
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,740
So much for that. Now what? Huh?

199
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:52,260
Don't worry, I've got a plan.

200
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,380
Hop on, I'll tell you.

201
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:15,420
He leisurely circles her navel
with the end of the riding whip.

202
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,700
He grins wickedly at
her, tantalizing her.

203
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,740
Suddenly, he flicks the whip
and a shock runs through her.

204
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,100
The pain surges, he hits
her harder. She cries out.

205
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:31,404
He keeps whipping her.
Her buttocks, breasts...

206
00:22:31,405 --> 00:22:34,260
everywhere. She moans loudly.

207
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,580
He kisses her, she's
mesmerized. Suddenly...

208
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,940
he pulls away, bending her over.

209
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:43,180
He starts lashing her. Faster, harder.

210
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,380
She's mewling, whimpering
as she tries to squirm away.

211
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,780
"Scream for me".

212
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,140
Listen! Have you seen Golu?

213
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,340
She does, loudly.

214
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,940
Over and over.

215
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:06,460
He fingers her. Quick and hard.
Easing out of her slowly, and then...

216
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,220
slamming back in, jolting her forward.

217
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,220
Until finally, she can't take any more.

218
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:16,060
She comes, screaming, "Ahh.."

219
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,300
Golu!

220
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,860
... transport to the...

221
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,180
Why do you always study in
these dingy corners, Golu?

222
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:38,900
Look at all that sweat.

223
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,660
Traveled the whole world, have you?

224
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,060
Yes, sis. Toured the heavens as well.

225
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,500
- Did you hear?
- Yesterday, Munna barged into Dimpy's house

226
00:23:50,501 --> 00:23:51,501
and created a ruckus.

227
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,620
That's all he ever does anyway.

228
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,180
Oh, hand me that book, please!
The Ethics of Advertising.

229
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:02,740
If you keep reading these
huge books, you'll go blind.

230
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,876
Bhaiyaji, so what happened
with those boys yesterday?

231
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,020
Did you fuck them up?

232
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,300
Listen, motherfucker.

233
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,100
Don't spoil my mood early
in the morning, alright?

234
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,340
If anyone so much as utters a word...

235
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:51,500
I'll have their skin
flayed and made into a drum.

236
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,380
And I'll play it loudly.

237
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:08,340
Oh, Munna! Come in.

238
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,500
Tell me.

239
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:20,980
Deepu Singh was just here.

240
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,820
Yeah, I saw him.

241
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,380
He's withdrawn his nomination.

242
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,620
Oh?

243
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:36,100
That's good. Less
competition for me now.

244
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,540
Why are you getting so worried?

245
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:43,500
It's just that my
reputation is on the line.

246
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,460
I want to be the election
overseer next year too.

247
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,540
Whether the election is fair
or not, it should look fair.

248
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,420
Democracy at work, son.

249
00:25:58,180 --> 00:25:59,540
Well, figure something out then.

250
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,060
I'll do that, but I
have some advice for you.

251
00:26:11,140 --> 00:26:15,460
If you want to be a politician,
employ goons. Don't be a goon.

252
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:30,500
And, from tomorrow, no
more brawling on campus.

253
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,460
Why is it needed?

254
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,220
Alright, sir.

255
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:41,420
You promise?

256
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,100
I swear on my mother, sir!

257
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,940
I'll take your leave now.

258
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,460
Your mother died years ago.

259
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,500
Those sunglasses really
suit you, honestly.

260
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,220
You look like a film star.

261
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:55,820
It's looking good.

262
00:26:57,460 --> 00:27:00,300
Thanks. Worn them since childhood.

263
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:06,540
What did he say?

264
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,860
No whacking people on
campus from tomorrow.

265
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,580
Oh. I see.

266
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,460
So... today is still open season, right?

267
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:19,020
Hey! Sweety!

268
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,900
Sweety!

269
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,660
What is it, Munna?

270
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,140
I'd sent some mutton with
your father yesterday.

271
00:27:27,420 --> 00:27:28,420
Did you like it?

272
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,060
I'm vegetarian.

273
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,620
Oh? Since when?

274
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:35,140
Since you sent that mutton.

275
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:39,580
Well then, there's a new movie
on. On the Wings of Dreams.

276
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,260
- You wanna go?
- No!

277
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,700
Have you slapped on all
this makeup for the movie?

278
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,460
Sweety! Listen!

279
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:54,140
Sweety, there's a new popcorn
machine at Shilpi Talkies!

280
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:57,220
Chocolate popcorn!
It'll be great fun. Come.

281
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:59,100
Should she just have
sex with you right here?

282
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,940
That's your endgame, isn't it?

283
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:07,180
Miss Golu, you're young, behave like it.

284
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:08,740
Don't interrupt, understood?

285
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:13,940
Otherwise, when you become my
sister-in-law, I'll set you straight.

286
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:18,420
Sweety is my love.

287
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,620
And, anyway...

288
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:26,300
your father comes to my house
everyday, like a pilgrim to the temple.

289
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,140
Well then, why not
take him for the movie?

290
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,860
Just grab a corner seat
and plop into his lap!

291
00:28:35,020 --> 00:28:37,300
You're flying high because
Munna bhaiya is being nice.

292
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,996
We'll have you picked
up in broad daylight.

293
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:42,780
I'll whack you so hard with my shoe,

294
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,220
your face will turn as
red as a baboon's ass.

295
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:48,540
- I was just...
- Hey, didn't I tell you to keep your mouth shut?

296
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:49,740
Or I'll wallop you.

297
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:50,940
She's your sister-in-law.

298
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,260
Don't you understand, Munna?

299
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,380
- No, Sweety, I'm sorry...
- I'm not interested in you.

300
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
Rickshaw!

301
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,180
Sweety...

302
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:14,140
Guys, when a girl says no,
she actually means yes. Get it?

303
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:19,420
I could kill for some "medicine",
Compounder. Is your dispensary open?

304
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,180
It's always open for you, Munna bhaiya.

305
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:23,220
That's my man.

306
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:27,060
And you, fucker, how
many times have I told...

307
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,740
This snake is 3 feet long and
just a couple of months old.

308
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:36,380
Despite that, it's considered
the most lethal predator around.

309
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:39,100
One bite and death is inevitable.

310
00:29:39,101 --> 00:29:41,260
The dense jungle and the nearby river...

311
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,660
Greetings, Bauji.

312
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,260
Bless you, son.

313
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:47,980
This reminds me of Rati Shankar Shukla.

314
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:51,540
Feed a snake all you want...

315
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,980
but you can never trust it.

316
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,140
However dangerous a snake might be...

317
00:29:59,980 --> 00:30:03,340
the snake charmer should
always be in control.

318
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,500
Just... stay alert.

319
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:11,740
... waiting for the
right moment to pounce.

320
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,500
Well, then... Is it done?

321
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,700
Yes, sir. Here.

322
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:28,180
- Here.
- Oh no, sir, please don't.

323
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,620
Usmaan miyan, you know me!

324
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,060
I only take what is mine
by right, not by might.

325
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,140
Take it!

326
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,580
Keep it!

327
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,420
Has the new stock arrived?

328
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,380
Let me know if there's any trouble.

329
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,380
Kaaleen bhaiya has given me
full control of this operation.

330
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,740
Here you go.

331
00:31:06,260 --> 00:31:08,140
Bravo, my man.

332
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:09,580
This is what I call by right.

333
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,020
He's saying he's collecting
cash from the distributors.

334
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,420
Son. Which distributor are you with?

335
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,620
This... uhmm... the one
from Mukeri Bazaar, Papa.

336
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:03,100
Have you collected the cash?

337
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,060
Yes, just, it's almost done.

338
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,500
How much is it?

339
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:09,140
I haven't counted it yet, Papa.

340
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:10,940
Count it.

341
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,020
Brijeshji!

342
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:19,140
Who's the Mukeri Bazaar distributor?

343
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:21,060
Rajan Mishra.

344
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,580
Yes... yes, sir.

345
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:25,540
Yes, you...

346
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,980
Do you think I'm an idiot?

347
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,780
All the distributors are
queued up here in the square.

348
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:36,700
What payment are you collecting, son?

349
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:38,260
Huh?

350
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:40,580
At least, learn to lie properly.

351
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,620
Now hang up!

352
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:57,540
I'm done. Let's go.

353
00:32:58,420 --> 00:32:59,460
Bhaiyaji... ?

354
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,980
Bhaiyaji!

355
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,700
How much is it, Brijesh?

356
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:14,340
Sir, it's 15% lesser than last week.

357
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,060
And we have more fraud guns this time.

358
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:20,900
Great.

359
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:31,180
What should we do about
Munna's idiocy, Maqbool?

360
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,860
How will he handle everything?

361
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,340
How about a second son, then?

362
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:41,220
Yours and mine.

363
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:44,980
I'm ovulating.

364
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,100
Yes, yes. Is... is the
tea served? You go on then.

365
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,620
Hey, Maqbool.

366
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,420
Take care of Munna.

367
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,700
Remember what the cop
said about Rati Shankar.

368
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
Yes.

369
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:15,460
Brijeshji, dispose of the fraud guns.

370
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,580
Guddu bhaiya!

371
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,940
Put that away.

372
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,300
You've started here too?

373
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,820
Bodybuilding is all about dedication.

374
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,300
Missed last night's workout,
thanks to Kaaleen bhaiya.

375
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,860
He's coming.

376
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:13,900
Greetings.

377
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,020
Greetings.

378
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:18,660
The groom who passed
away, his family here?

379
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:19,900
Come in.

380
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,260
Yes, I filed the case,
the groom was my nephew.

381
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:35,020
Alright, Uncle, you filed it...

382
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:37,076
now you'll be the one withdrawing it.

383
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:38,380
Why will I withdraw it?

384
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,180
This boy fired the gun.

385
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,100
In front of my very eyes!

386
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,540
I'll identify him.

387
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,180
Let us identify him for you.

388
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,620
His name is Munna Tripathi.

389
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,580
And he's Akhandanand
Tripathi's only son.

390
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,100
Now, you don't know who he is
because you're not from these parts.

391
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,020
- He's a don.
- Whoever he may be, I'm not worried about him.

392
00:36:00,140 --> 00:36:03,460
Uncle, you're not scared,
but I'm very worried for you.

393
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:05,380
You don't seem to
understand what we're saying.

394
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:14,300
Listen carefully, Uncle.

395
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,860
We've just joined them.

396
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:20,100
And I'm eager to start.

397
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:23,420
I'll inaugurate my career
with you. Understood?

398
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:24,980
Hold on.

399
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:36,380
We're giving you compensation.

400
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:38,740
Forget what happened.

401
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:40,340
End the matter here.

402
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:43,020
Why are you offering them cash?

403
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:45,380
Didn't I say that we'll
sort it out with the gun?

404
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,060
Why give them an option?

405
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,060
They're confused now.

406
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:54,860
So, Uncle, everything
is laid out before you.

407
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,460
The matter can be solved both ways.

408
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:00,220
The choice is yours.

409
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:15,180
Take your money and get out.

410
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,060
Then...

411
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,660
He's slipping.

412
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:27,460
My life is in your hands, brother.

413
00:37:29,420 --> 00:37:31,940
Save me!

414
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,380
I'm like your son.

415
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,180
Why are you taking all this
unnecessary risk? End the matter!

416
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,260
Please, brother.

417
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:45,260
I have a heart condition,
this isn't good for me!

418
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:49,100
The pain is mine alone.

419
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,140
He was my son.

420
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,460
Brother!

421
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:10,180
Alright. We'll withdraw, let him go.

422
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,620
Please, for heaven's sake, pull me up.

423
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:15,060
Yes, Mummy.

424
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:17,180
I'd sent some money through
Raja. Did you get it?

425
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,820
Did you count it?

426
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,460
How's Papa?

427
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,700
Hmm.

428
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:34,700
Yes... I'm fine.

429
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:41,740
It's a marriage of convenience...

430
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,500
so I'm as well as can be expected.

431
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,540
Mummy, if I'm pregnant,
you'll be the first to know.

432
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:56,820
I'm trying. Why must you ask me every...

433
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,700
Hey. Where's Munna?

434
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:02,380
Why, what happened?

435
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:05,100
It's been some time
since Munna bhaiya left.

436
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,620
I don't know where he is.

437
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,100
Should I come with you?

438
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:11,980
No. I'll handle it.

439
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:13,300
Alright.

440
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:18,340
237, 238, 39, 40, 41...

441
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:22,180
42, 43, 44, 45, 46...

442
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:25,700
47, 48, 49, 50...

443
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:28,700
51, 52, 53, 54...

444
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:31,180
55, 56, 57...

445
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:33,540
58, 59, 60...

446
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:36,860
61, 62, 63, 64...

447
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,020
65, 66, 67...

448
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,740
68, 69, 70...

449
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,380
71, 72, 73, 74...

450
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,700
Greetings, Rati Shankar bhaiya.

451
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,900
I'll be back.

452
00:39:58,980 --> 00:39:59,980
Okay.

453
00:40:00,020 --> 00:40:01,540
Park the car up ahead.

454
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:03,140
Or Sharad will get irritated.

455
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,340
Come, sir.

456
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,780
Look at you.

457
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:18,780
Can't even unfold a fucking chair.

458
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,020
Well? Huh?

459
00:40:28,140 --> 00:40:30,820
Rati bhaiya, my accounts were correct.

460
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,780
These guys are the
ones who are mistaken.

461
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,980
Here, I'm making plans
to take over Mirzapur...

462
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,260
and you're trying to destroy
Jaunpur behind my back.

463
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,020
I haven't made any mistakes, bhaiya.

464
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:44,980
Well, if you haven't done anything
wrong, then you won't be punished.

465
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:46,900
Yeah?

466
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,700
Alright, recite the alphabet.

467
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,580
Well, why aren't you reciting it?

468
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:53,780
It's true.

469
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:56,220
Recite it properly,

470
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:58,620
no mistakes and you walk free.

471
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:07,180
83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88...

472
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:12,580
89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95...

473
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,740
96, 97, 98...

474
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,060
Get up. Let's go.

475
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,980
We'll get to 300 against the wall.

476
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,596
Raise your legs, wrap them around me.

477
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:23,300
98, 99, 300.

478
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:28,300
A, B, C, D, E, F, G...

479
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,340
Hey, Prince Charles.

480
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:33,100
The Hindi alphabet.

481
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:36,860
Come on.

482
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:38,140
Say it.

483
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,300
Oi, start!

484
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:45,220
A, B, C, D, E...

485
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:51,620
F, G, H, I...

486
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:53,940
... T

487
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,460
Ah, slipped up, hmm?

488
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:59,220
J.

489
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:04,860
F, G, H, I... J.

490
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,860
You could've been saved today if
you'd bothered attending school.

491
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,820
Bha... bhaiya!

492
00:42:11,940 --> 00:42:13,820
You're gonna ruin my fucking clothes.

493
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,820
Rati bhaiya! Rati bhaiya!

494
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:31,100
How are you, Akhanda?

495
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,500
Huh?

496
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,860
How come you called?

497
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:40,220
Huh, what are you talking about?
Why would I send someone to Mirzapur?

498
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:58,980
Munna is like a son to me.

499
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,580
He's fine, isn't he?

500
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,940
Motherfucker.

501
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,740
Motherfucker.

502
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:10,820
Motherfucker.

503
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,540
Can't even fuck in peace.

504
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:23,000
