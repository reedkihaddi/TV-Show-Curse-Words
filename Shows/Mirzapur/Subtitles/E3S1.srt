2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:17,220
Ladies and gentlemen, the wait is over!

3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:23,660
Presenting the next
act of the Ram Leela!

4
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:40,860
All hail Lord Ram!

5
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:42,780
Can I have some?

6
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:44,100
No, it's mine.

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:45,580
Get your own!

8
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:49,900
Now we'll see how
Shurpanakha lost her nose!

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,900
Even Shurpanakha has arrived.

10
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:53,380
Where is Bauji, Akhanda?

11
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,660
He must be on his way, Rati Shankar.

12
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,820
What an abundant garden!

13
00:00:58,020 --> 00:00:59,020
Yes, Mistress.

14
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,140
We'll definitely find fruit here.

15
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:06,780
Munna! For you, have fun!

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,420
Here, sir. Have a seat.

17
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:10,140
- Sit, sit.
- Greetings!

18
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:12,060
Shurpanakha's just come.

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,940
Go on then.

20
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,580
Bring the fruit...

21
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:21,500
As you command, Mistress.

22
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,580
These are Thakur's goons!

23
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,500
Take Munna and go!

24
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,940
You're being cocky, Tripathi.

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:18,580
But you've forgotten that
Mirzapur has only one don:

26
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,380
Ajit Thakur.

27
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:29,700
I will rule Mirzapur.

28
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:37,820
Bauji, he's broken the code,
attacked us in our family's presence.

29
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,340
Motherfucker!

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:46,140
Mirzapur will soon belong to
the Tripathis, not the Thakurs!

31
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,540
How much longer?

32
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:16,580
Another two hours, Thakur sir.

33
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,740
Akhanda! Rati Shankar!

34
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,220
Let's go!

35
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,020
You brought this upon
yourself, Ajit Thakur.

36
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,700
You sent your men
when I was with family.

37
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,180
I'm just returning the favour.

38
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,420
Ajit Thakur is no more.

39
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,580
Here is the proof!

40
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,740
Mirzapur is now mine!

41
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,620
I am...

42
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,620
Satyanand Tripathi!

43
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,900
Mirzapur's new don.

44
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,900
I will have two successors.

45
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,420
Akhandanand Tripathi...

46
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,300
and

47
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,660
Munna Tripathi.

48
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,500
And this is...

49
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,980
Rati Shankar Shukla.

50
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,100
He's like family...

51
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,100
loyal.

52
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,600
Long live Satyanand Tripathi!

53
00:05:25,301 --> 00:05:27,301
Long live Satyanand Tripathi!

54
00:05:27,902 --> 00:05:30,082
Long live Satyanand Tripathi!

55
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,820
It would've been easier
to just shoot him.

56
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,740
Fine.

57
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,220
Is your decision final, Sharad?

58
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:25,700
Won't you come handle the
family business in Jaunpur?

59
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:30,460
Your question doesn't change
and neither does my answer.

60
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,380
I don't want any part
of this... business.

61
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,860
Once I'm done with my Bachelor's,
I'll apply for Master's.

62
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,220
I want Mirzapur, Sharad.

63
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,100
At any cost.

64
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,020
You have Jaunpur. Isn't that enough?

65
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,140
Leave Mirzapur alone.

66
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,780
And Papa, forget about the scar.

67
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,220
How can I?!

68
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,860
It keeps my memory sharp.

69
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,540
I sent a guy to take care of Munna.

70
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,100
He failed, the cuntlicker.

71
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,740
Even though Munna is the weakest
link in the Tripathi family.

72
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,380
You're going after the pawn.

73
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,940
But chess is won by killing the king.

74
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,420
And not on his ground.

75
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:49,340
Wait for when Akhandanand
is on neutral ground.

76
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,700
Easy.

77
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,660
Come on man, drive the car.

78
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,820
Sharad's flight is in two hours.

79
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,500
Good morning, sir.

80
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,100
Come in, darling.

81
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:21,340
Please, sir. You could
just call me Raja.

82
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,940
Why do you always pull my leg?

83
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:25,940
Well, it's not like you
have anything else to pull.

84
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,780
- Is the car ready?
- Yes, sir.

85
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:33,180
Alright.

86
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,900
Sir!

87
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,220
Hmm?

88
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,860
Ma'am, what shall I make for lunch?

89
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:26,700
Greetings bhaiya.
- Greetings kaaleen.

90
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,180
Greetings sir.

91
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,100
Greetings sir, the iron is ready.

92
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,980
Sir, where does all this iron come from?

93
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:20,660
Homespun guns are made from
the steering wheels of trucks.

94
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,060
Cheap and best.

95
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:29,980
Earlier, we used to use parts
from cars and motorcycles.

96
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:33,740
You're in charge of
quality control, Upadhay.

97
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,180
They shouldn't be exploding.

98
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
Yes, sir.

99
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:41,060
All these... are ready.

100
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,540
Show them.

101
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:58,180
Sir. The ones you gave us...

102
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
These...

103
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,700
These are sexier.

104
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,340
We don't make these.

105
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:06,500
We import them for special clients.

106
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,700
And, of course, for family.

107
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,140
Sir!

108
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,780
And... where do the bullets come from?

109
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,860
Numerous roads.

110
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:23,180
The higher the toll,
the better the road.

111
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:31,100
How many guns were fired, Dikshit?

112
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,620
Sixty-five, sir.

113
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:35,580
And how many boxes were confiscated?

114
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:36,900
Sir, thirty-five.

115
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,700
The rest?

116
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,900
Vanished.

117
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,780
Bullets are just like
printer cartridges.

118
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,580
You can buy originals, or
get refills for the old ones.

119
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,500
The printer will work
with either cartridge.

120
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,860
We take these used shells,

121
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,420
fill them with gunpowder

122
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,060
and cork them.

123
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,340
It's spanking-new.

124
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,220
Last month, we'd hired two new boys.

125
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,700
After lunch, they lit a cigarette.

126
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:20,060
And blew up.

127
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,060
Thank the Lord, the
factory was untouched.

128
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:26,620
Maqbool, get the car.

129
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:47,900
Long live JP Yadav!

130
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,991
Long live JP Yadav!

131
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,580
How is the Honorable Chief
Minister, Mr JP Yadav?

132
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,220
Brother's fine.

133
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:14,220
Election season's here, so he's busy.

134
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,165
The opposition is
investing a lot of money

135
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,420
in Mirzapur this time around.

136
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,900
They'll give us a fight.

137
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:24,420
No, nothing to worry about.

138
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,260
All of Uttar Pradesh stands with you.

139
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:29,700
The fuck will Uttar
Pradesh do for us, Tripathi?

140
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,380
The people of Uttar
Pradesh must be on our side.

141
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:36,460
People say, politicians
are greedy whores.

142
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,900
It's the public who are whores.

143
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:41,740
They go sleep with
whoever offers them money.

144
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,460
Do you understand?

145
00:14:45,140 --> 00:14:46,260
I do.

146
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,380
Well, then, where is my money?

147
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:59,420
You rule over Mirzapur, the
throne of eastern Uttar Pradesh.

148
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:06,260
And you do that because the
Chief Minister and I support you.

149
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:12,940
The day we snatch away that support,
you'll be begging in the streets.

150
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:23,140
Mr JP Yadav, the business
is not doing well.

151
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,940
I'm working on it.

152
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,180
Are you?

153
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,700
I'll get you the funds, don't worry.

154
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,940
Why would I worry?

155
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,220
There are many businessmen
in Uttar Pradesh

156
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:41,140
... but only one Chief Minister.

157
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:47,300
Oh, Rati Shankar got in touch with me.

158
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,420
He called me.

159
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,500
Just a courtesy call.

160
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,340
It doesn't really involve you
but I figured I'd let you know.

161
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,500
Come, come, Satya!

162
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,780
Take a look at this poster, Mr Yadav.

163
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,580
Got them printed for publicity.

164
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,500
How tall do you stand?

165
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,940
5'8".

166
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,140
How tall do you stand in the party?

167
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:25,220
Why is your picture the same
size as the Chief Minister's?

168
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,820
I'll get it changed.

169
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,620
How many did you print?

170
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,780
20,000.

171
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:49,900
Mr Prakash, once you get
them re-sized and printed,

172
00:16:49,901 --> 00:16:52,620
send the bill to me.

173
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,100
Hmm?

174
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,780
Come.

175
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,020
Okay. Greetings.

176
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:08,300
Long live JP Yadav!

177
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:15,820
East or west! JP Yadav is the best!

178
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:18,940
Maqbool. Fix a meeting with Lala.

179
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:24,020
Long live JP Yadav!

180
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,220
Listen.

181
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:28,220
Put my photograph on the poster too.

182
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,220
Right next to the Chief Minister.

183
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:32,060
The same size.

184
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,260
Black nail polish? Yuck!

185
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:57,820
Sis, this nail polish is for
me, not everything is about boys.

186
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,660
Look at how it's sparkling!

187
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,060
And that's how you service a gun.

188
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,980
I don't care.

189
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Anyway, what will I do with it?

190
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:13,420
What if you'll need to
fire it to save me someday?

191
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:17,780
Go on, give it a shot.

192
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,180
Alright fine, don't.

193
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,340
Can I ask you something, Golu?

194
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,380
Hmm?

195
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,500
Should I take things forward with Guddu?

196
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,420
You're asking for my advice on love?

197
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:38,876
I've never even had a boyfriend.

198
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,140
You should try it.

199
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:41,860
Where will all this reading get you?

200
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,700
You gotta have some fun before marriage.

201
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:49,100
Sis, you can have all the
fun for the both of us!

202
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,260
See ya.

203
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,380
Come quickly, papa.

204
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:00,500
It's your turn.

205
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,420
Yes, yes. I'm coming.

206
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,300
I'm here.

207
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,740
You've serviced the gun well.

208
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:17,460
My turn...

209
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,060
And, how's college going?

210
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,220
Oh, it's fine.

211
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,900
If there's any trouble,
tell Munna bhaiya.

212
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,780
You girls probably see him every day.

213
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:28,980
Munna is the one causing the trouble.

214
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,380
He swoops down on sis all
the time, wherever she goes.

215
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,620
Munna bhaiya will be
king of Mirzapur one day.

216
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:39,220
And his bride will rule over the town.

217
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,340
Well, then let some
other girl's fate shine.

218
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,900
What do I care?

219
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:48,140
And why do you keep referring
to him so respectfully?

220
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:51,460
He's a roadside goon, that's all!

221
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:05,180
Radhiya!

222
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,380
Yes?

223
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:12,540
Munna looks tired.

224
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:15,420
Go, help him relax.

225
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,260
Ma'am...

226
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,100
He's very rough.

227
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,260
Like an animal,

228
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,020
he doesn't stop for hours.

229
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,500
Oh?

230
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,500
Please, not tonight. I can't...

231
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,260
Go.

232
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,340
Go on.

233
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,700
Neither your home nor mine.

234
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,300
Neutral ground is always best.

235
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:30,460
Lala, I want greater
quantities of "silk".

236
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,580
Munna isn't here?

237
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,060
He usually comes in your place.

238
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,860
He's under the weather.

239
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,700
The elections are almost here.

240
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,060
I need more money.

241
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:53,700
Mr Tripathi, you already know...

242
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,620
silk is like diamonds.

243
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:03,220
Only by controlling the supply
can you control the price.

244
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,660
But, we're old friends.

245
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,180
I'll give it a try.

246
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,700
Here, give me the bill.

247
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,220
No, no.

248
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,900
This... is for my daughter.

249
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,020
I'll take your leave now.

250
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:49,260
Precaution is wise, Lala.

251
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,540
Weren't you guys already dating?

252
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:59,180
Yes, but our marriage is arranged.

253
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:00,980
Don't change the subject.

254
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,500
I'm telling you right now.

255
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:05,260
If you don't attend my wedding, then...

256
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,780
Then what? You won't get married?

257
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:08,020
Yes, exactly!

258
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,500
- Salaam, Abbu.
- Yes, salaam.

259
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:22,100
Oh my, you've bought the whole market.

260
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,580
Abbu, this is my friend, Dimpy.

261
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:28,140
- Greetings.
- She lives in Mirzapur.

262
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,876
I asked her to help
me with the shopping.

263
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,940
And lo behold, here she is.

264
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,660
Your mutton.

265
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,580
Thank you.

266
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,780
Hi, I'm RJ Surbhi on 95 Big FM.

267
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,400
And in the Breezy Bihari series,

268
00:23:44,401 --> 00:23:49,180
we've gathered the
breeziest babes of Bihar.

269
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,340
Greetings bhaiya.

270
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,620
Kaaleen bhaiya,

271
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:12,620
All of Purvanchal respects you.

272
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:15,540
Maqbool, they don't
respect me, they fear me.

273
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,596
But, that's the problem with fear.

274
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:19,180
It doesn't last.

275
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:21,380
Let's go.

276
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:40,780
Greetings, sir!

277
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:42,700
- How are you?
- Fine, sir.

278
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:45,100
Been a while, hasn't it?

279
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:47,980
You know me, I always drop
in when I'm passing through.

280
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Get me some buttermilk.

281
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,420
Sir!

282
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,580
Maqbool! We need the
motherfuckers alive.

283
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,860
Wait.

284
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,300
Get them motherfuckers!

285
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,140
Forgive us!

286
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:15,060
Who was it?

287
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:21,100
If we give you his name, he'll kill us.

288
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,940
Rati Shankar sent us.

289
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:43,100
He supplied the guns and money.

290
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:51,980
He usually gives us a photo.

291
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:59,900
But everyone knows Kaaleen bhaiya.

292
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:00,980
Maqbool,

293
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,500
I'm leaving.

294
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,420
Yes, sir.

295
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,460
Forgive us!

296
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,940
I have children!

297
00:27:12,060 --> 00:27:13,660
Your children will thank me

298
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,660
if I kill you right here.

299
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:19,220
Anyway, what will you
be leaving them with?

300
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,900
The worst thing in
the world is a father.

301
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,260
Don't kill me.

302
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,220
I'm nobody's father!

303
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,500
Let me...

304
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,700
You gave me Rati
Shankar's name, didn't you?

305
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,500
I won't shoot you.

306
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,420
It looks like Rati Shankar's
brain has short-circuited.

307
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:13,060
So far...

308
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:15,860
he'd been conducting guerrila
attacks like a yellow-bellied cunt.

309
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,220
He went after Munna...

310
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,660
and then me.

311
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:21,260
Let's kill Rati Shankar Shukla.

312
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,460
He thinks we're idiots.

313
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,740
- Munna, calm down.
- Why the fuck should I?

314
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,180
Shut up.

315
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,180
Son, Rati Shankar will be ready

316
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:31,940
and waiting for us to retaliate.

317
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:34,140
We'll deal with him at the right time.

318
00:29:36,940 --> 00:29:39,460
Let's bring up the matter
in the next meeting, Bauji.

319
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:41,780
All the district dons will be there too.

320
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:43,700
Fuckall will happen
with all your chattering.

321
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:45,060
This again?

322
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,140
Breathe in!

323
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,940
Breathe out.

324
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,620
Oh, and...

325
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,380
you need to explain the gun
distribution system to Guddu and Bablu.

326
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,660
I'll handle the rest.

327
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,380
Alright, Bauji.

328
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,900
I'll be going. I'd just
come for your advice.

329
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,500
You sit on Mirzapur's
throne, Akhanda, not I.

330
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:19,260
Whatever decision you take,
it will be the right one.

331
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:29,900
I'm leaving too.

332
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:43,940
I shouldn't have left things unfinished.

333
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,500
The wound is deep.

334
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,580
Lie down.

335
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,700
Here.

336
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:11,300
Greetings, Bauji.

337
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:19,900
Some water, please?

338
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,700
What happened, Rati Shankar?

339
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,140
You're looking nervous.

340
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:39,180
Loyal.

341
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:43,620
Do you think I'm your dog?

342
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:39,180
Akhanda!

343
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,340
Don't kill him.

344
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:44,860
Don't kill him.

345
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:53,620
He was shot in the spine.

346
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,700
He might be paralysed.

347
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,260
Maqbool.

348
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,380
Yes, Bauji?

349
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,780
How's your mother?

350
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,220
She'll be fine, she's in the hospital.

351
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,940
Maqbool Khan will always
be loyal to you, Bauji.

352
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:14,460
No matter what.

353
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,060
Akhanda.

354
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,500
Bring Rati Shankar...

355
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Rati...

356
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,820
Loyalty

357
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,260
is not a dirty word,

358
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:44,420
it's a virtue.

359
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,620
I give you Jaunpur.

360
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:00,940
Do not even glance

361
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,780
towards Mirzapur.

362
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,340
Akhanda.

363
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:11,260
Leave him at the border...

364
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:13,500
alive.

365
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,636
We were brothers, Rati Shankar.

366
00:34:16,660 --> 00:34:18,140
No, we weren't, Akhanda!

367
00:34:20,460 --> 00:34:21,500
We weren't.

368
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:24,260
You know this as well as I do.

369
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:27,540
And if anyone knows
this better than us...

370
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,580
... it's Bauji.
- Don't you mention Bauji!

371
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:34,140
You shot Bauji!

372
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,860
Do you think we'll let
you get away with that?

373
00:34:54,660 --> 00:34:57,164
This will remind you
that you were kicked out

374
00:34:57,165 --> 00:34:59,740
of Mirzapur like a bloody dog.

375
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:02,820
A dog that

376
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:04,420
couldn't even be loyal.

377
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,340
There he is.

378
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,620
- Has Munna arrived?
- Yes, he's inside.

379
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:42,460
This is the Tripathi family.

380
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:46,780
We make guns, and control them too.

381
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,620
These are the distributors.

382
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,020
They procure guns
from us, and sell them.

383
00:35:58,940 --> 00:36:00,620
And most important of all,

384
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,060
the customer.

385
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,940
They buy guns from the distributors.

386
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:10,260
And who heads this entire network?

387
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,780
Munna Tripathi.

388
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,300
Sir, if you...

389
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:22,540
if you kill someone with a homespun
gun, doesn't the gun get traced?

390
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:25,340
And what if you get caught?

391
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,340
Homespun guns don't have
registration numbers.

392
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:30,140
Also, the guns are
merely 1500-2000 rupees.

393
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,140
Whack someone and dump
the gun in a ditch.

394
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,980
And anyway, homespun guns
aren't used only to kill.

395
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,220
They can be used to scare people too.

396
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:42,180
Also in election rallies,
for celebrating...

397
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,980
Like you did at that
wedding the other day?

398
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:56,660
I want you to expand the gun business.

399
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,260
Do so, whether with brains, or brawn.

400
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,420
You have a free hand.

401
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:12,220
Will you be able to do it?

402
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:13,980
Yes...

403
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,340
Yes, why not? Of course.

404
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:22,980
Yes.

405
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:53,860
I tried really hard this time.

406
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,060
Did you...

407
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,820
Yes, of course.

408
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,500
Didn't you hear me?

409
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,260
Are you sure?

410
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,220
Why would I lie?

411
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,900
You were great.

412
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,460
Come in, Munna bhaiya.

413
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,940
What brings you to my room this morning?

414
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:37,220
Come.

415
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:07,380
Papa thinks I'm a dickhead.

416
00:39:10,180 --> 00:39:11,700
That I can't handle the business.

417
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,540
You're not a dickhead!

418
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,700
I'm confident you can
handle the business.

419
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:19,580
And handle it well, at that.

420
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,940
Your father is growing old.

421
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:27,180
Trust me, I'd know.

422
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,300
Sooner or later, you'll
control the business.

423
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:31,540
Just be prepared, Munna bhaiya...

424
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,220
... for when the time comes.

425
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:36,780
Why do you call me Munna bhaiya?

426
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,940
Call me Munna.

427
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:43,220
- After all, our relationship is also...
- Alright, I'll call you Munna.

428
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,380
Munna.

429
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,140
But, don't you dare call me Mum.

430
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,820
How does it smell?

431
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:01,980
Ittar of rose.

432
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:04,940
There's some here too.

433
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:11,420
- Sir?
- Hmm?

434
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,300
We've rolled out eight trucks of carpet.

435
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,980
Alright, very good.

436
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,620
Sir, there was one more thing.

437
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:24,180
Yes?

438
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:32,580
We've just had a daughter, sir.

439
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,420
We came for your blessings.

440
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,780
Keep it.

441
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,820
What have you named her?

442
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:51,260
Sir, we've named her after your wife.

443
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:52,740
Beena.

444
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:56,060
Okay.

445
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,060
Harder!

446
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,180
Kaaleen bhaiya never lasts this long.

447
