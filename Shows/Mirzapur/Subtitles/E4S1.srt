2
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:13,290
... this lioness can mate
up to 100 times in 3 days.

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:16,690
Her goal is not just to
ensure a new generation,

4
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,450
the desire to achieve her own
pleasure is also very strong.

5
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,170
Kaaleen bhaiya never lasts this long.

6
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,970
The lion may be called
the king of the jungle

7
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,370
but during sex, it is the
lioness who is in charge.

8
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:13,690
Harder...

9
00:01:14,090 --> 00:01:15,610
Harder...

10
00:01:16,970 --> 00:01:18,130
Oh, Raja!

11
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:26,570
Ma'am, I'm very close.

12
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:27,970
Shut up!

13
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,410
It's time for Bauji's dinner.

14
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,050
Once he has impregnated her
and brought her pleasure,

15
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,650
the lion is of no use to the lioness.

16
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:38,450
Yes? Who is it?

17
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:40,610
Hello, Sir. You asked for me?

18
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,330
Oh, yes.

19
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,170
Golu.

20
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,130
Let me come straight to the point.

21
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:51,610
Okay, sir.

22
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,090
You're first on the honor roll.

23
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,290
A most sincere student.

24
00:03:58,730 --> 00:03:59,890
Popular too.

25
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:05,810
Lately... the college
environment hasn't been ideal.

26
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,730
Sir, you haven't come to the point.

27
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:11,330
I'm coming to the point!

28
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:12,850
I'm on the way.

29
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,050
"Haven't come to the point... "

30
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,450
Will you contest the election?

31
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:25,770
Deepu has withdrawn his nomination.

32
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:27,090
And Munna...

33
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:29,370
refuses to change his ways.

34
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:32,490
If you run...

35
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:34,130
he'll be challenged.

36
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:36,890
And if you win...

37
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:39,130
the college will benefit.

38
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,250
Uhmm.

39
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,370
I'm not sure.

40
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:50,010
You've caught me off guard.

41
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,290
I didn't mean to.

42
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,810
You have plenty of time.

43
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,170
Sleep on it,

44
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,890
let me know.

45
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,530
It won't be easy.

46
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,930
And that's why I'm asking you.

47
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,410
Yes, sir.

48
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:13,570
I will think about it.

49
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:26,730
Dude. I just can't tell
anymore, Guddu bhaiya.

50
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,730
Why don't you help us decide?

51
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:32,250
Sir, I've shown you so many sarees.

52
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,490
Just pick one.

53
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,690
Okay, wait.

54
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,410
This is our mum.

55
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:44,610
Oh, she's really fair.

56
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:46,730
Now I'll show you the good stuff.

57
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:48,410
What's your budget?

58
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,130
Don't worry about
that, show us the stuff.

59
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:54,290
Look at this classic.

60
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,090
Only 10,000.

61
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,330
We've 2,500.

62
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,970
You heard him.

63
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,170
Table 3 needs a bill.

64
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,570
- Your potato patty.
- Thanks.

65
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:22,370
Let's go.

66
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,170
The money?

67
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:26,970
Are you daft?

68
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,226
Guddu bhaiya, he's just a kid.

69
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,290
So are we.

70
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,090
Let's go.

71
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,650
Hey, pay up!

72
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:34,770
Here.

73
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,250
I see Maqbool got you a new gun.

74
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:48,690
It's gleaming.

75
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:52,010
We looked everywhere for the old one,

76
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:53,210
it's vanished.

77
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,330
Here you go.

78
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:08,570
Sit.

79
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,050
Akhanda...

80
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,930
... he takes cares of you?

81
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,530
He's so busy.

82
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,730
And I don't need taking
care of. I run this house.

83
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:47,530
Though, a child would've helped me cope.

84
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,410
Shall I go?

85
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:07,450
Hmm? Yes, go ahead.

86
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:23,370
Why are you getting caught
up in all this, Golu?

87
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,050
That's why I haven't agreed to it yet.

88
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,130
Told him I need to think about it.

89
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:31,970
Although,

90
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,050
he's right about one thing.

91
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:36,330
The college needs fixing.

92
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,290
Give me the shuttle. I'm on game point.

93
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,570
You'll win anyway.

94
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:45,170
Are you free tonight?

95
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:46,570
Why?

96
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:49,610
How about a cheeseburger
at the highway McDonald's?

97
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:51,090
What time?

98
00:08:53,890 --> 00:08:55,130
Huh? What... time... ?

99
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,810
You tell me. What's the
time right now? 2 o'clock.

100
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,066
- Let's go at 4 o'clock.
- 4 o'clock?

101
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:01,090
Yeah!

102
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,290
Oh gosh, I just remembered.

103
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:06,370
I'm having potato patties
with someone at 4 o'clock.

104
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,050
It's a date.

105
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:10,010
What, what... Who is this?

106
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:11,690
What's the name of this potato?

107
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:12,930
Why do you need his name?

108
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:16,650
Planning to go offer her
hand in marriage to him?

109
00:09:25,450 --> 00:09:28,010
You know, this whole
love thing is fucked up.

110
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:31,690
If it weren't for love,

111
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,222
I'd have chopped you both into pieces

112
00:09:34,223 --> 00:09:36,690
and thrown you into the
gutter a long time ago.

113
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:40,250
Look, Munna...

114
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:42,610
There are plenty of fish in the sea.

115
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,930
You like me; I don't like you.

116
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,770
Deal with it.

117
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:59,050
I'm not done here just yet, Sweety.

118
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,050
Fine.

119
00:10:03,290 --> 00:10:04,290
All the best.

120
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:10,530
Yeah, Compounder,

121
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:11,930
where are you?

122
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:13,890
Who're you going out with?

123
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,610
I wasn't...

124
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:19,250
but I will now.

125
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:23,650
Hello.

126
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:25,930
Yeah, Sweety. I'll be there.

127
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,410
What... what time?

128
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:28,850
What?

129
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:30,770
Hello?

130
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:34,090
Hello? H... hello?

131
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:35,210
Fuck...

132
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,570
I'll shove that horn up your ass.

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,306
What, are you gonna turn into
a helicopter and fly away?

134
00:10:39,330 --> 00:10:40,506
Can't you see I'm on the phone?!

135
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,530
Cuntlicker. Get going!

136
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:43,850
Beat it or I'll beat
you right here. Move it!

137
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,210
Hello?

138
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,690
Yeah, I'll be there. Yep, at 4.

139
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,330
And I haven't had
potato patties in ages.

140
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,290
Greetings, Satyaprakash.

141
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,770
Welcome, Munna bhaiya.

142
00:11:08,170 --> 00:11:09,170
Has the film started?

143
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:11,370
The previous show is
on, it'll take some time.

144
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,410
Restart it.

145
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:14,690
Sir!

146
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,490
Alright, everybody out.

147
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:19,090
The show is over,

148
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,490
we have to repair the system.

149
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,730
Shut down the projector, you fool!

150
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,650
[Anti-smoking warning]

151
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:47,010
Here, bhaiyaji.

152
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:48,330
Bring some ice.

153
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:49,410
Yes, sir.

154
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:54,130
Here, sir.

155
00:11:57,610 --> 00:11:59,050
Bro, why do I have to be here?

156
00:11:59,170 --> 00:12:00,690
I'm shitting bricks here, man.

157
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,210
Sweety asked me out.

158
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:04,290
Well, what use will I be?

159
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,650
Moral support, what else?

160
00:12:05,730 --> 00:12:06,730
Now shut up and move it.

161
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,650
Hurry up, man.

162
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,330
Calm down.

163
00:12:15,010 --> 00:12:16,050
Hold the saree, man!

164
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:17,250
Your assistant, am I?

165
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:45,490
Hi.

166
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,170
Hi.

167
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,010
Hi.

168
00:12:51,290 --> 00:12:52,290
We're done with "Hi".

169
00:12:52,970 --> 00:12:53,970
Yeah.

170
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:56,450
What will you have?

171
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,370
Potato patties.

172
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,810
That was the plan, no?

173
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,450
Go on then.

174
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,170
Uh, four potato patties

175
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,970
and four lemon sodas.

176
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,530
Just two patties and one soda here.

177
00:13:23,210 --> 00:13:25,010
Go sit there.

178
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:30,410
Bablu.

179
00:13:32,370 --> 00:13:34,130
- Bablu!
- I'm going. I'm going!

180
00:13:34,450 --> 00:13:35,930
Jeez, calm your tits.

181
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,210
- There's no need to get so antsy.
- Just go, man.

182
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,970
Er... May I...

183
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:18,290
Will you have something?

184
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,890
You should rest your chest too.

185
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,290
Sit down quietly.

186
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,850
This isn't a date.

187
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,170
What's your order, sir?

188
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,090
Just a glass of water for me.

189
00:14:35,490 --> 00:14:38,890
And nothing for her, she only
eats when she's on a date. Alright?

190
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:40,210
Go on then.

191
00:14:58,890 --> 00:15:01,250
This guy who Sweety is
going on a date with,

192
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,730
should we find him and fuck him up?

193
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,370
Come on, Munna bhaiya.

194
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:10,010
Nobody in Mirzapur would dare
to go on a date with Sweety.

195
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:11,570
Here.

196
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,210
Yeah, you're right.

197
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:20,290
But, Sweety really fucks with me.

198
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,490
Bhaiyaji, why are you bothering
with all this love bullshit?

199
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:25,250
Just stick to "wham,
bam, thank you ma'am".

200
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:31,370
Have you become mentally
unbalanced, son of a bitch?

201
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:35,090
You've already lost one ear,
I'll shoot the other one off too.

202
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,530
I'm serious about this girl,
it's not like with the others.

203
00:15:54,650 --> 00:15:55,650
Go on.

204
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,290
How'd you ask me out?

205
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,370
Why?

206
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,810
I shouldn't have?

207
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:34,370
I might ask you out again.

208
00:16:35,610 --> 00:16:36,610
Think about it.

209
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:43,010
I have.

210
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,850
Oh!

211
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:01,570
The great Mahadevi?

212
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,290
I'm a huge fan of her poetry!

213
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:10,970
No...

214
00:17:11,330 --> 00:17:13,010
don't get me wrong.

215
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,810
I'm actually a huge fan,
I'm not hitting on you.

216
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,706
Munna bhaiya, we thought you'd
beat the shit out of them.

217
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:21,890
They took you on.

218
00:17:22,970 --> 00:17:25,130
Oh, I wanted to, Compounder.

219
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,050
But, the business will be mine anyway.

220
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,690
Whenever I wish, they'll be...

221
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,250
That's true, Munna bhaiya.

222
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:36,610
The entire empire is all yours.

223
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,250
Yes... That it is.

224
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:43,530
Just a question of when.

225
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:45,690
Sooner or later.

226
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:52,290
If you wish, we could
speed it up, Munna bhaiya.

227
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,090
- Hmm?
- For you, I'd kill even Kaaleen bhaiya...

228
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:05,830
The fuck did you say?

229
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,266
- Nothing, Munna bhaiya.
- What the fuck did you say?!

230
00:18:07,290 --> 00:18:08,810
It was a slip of tongue, Munna bhaiya.

231
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,170
Motherfucker, you
want to kill my father?

232
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:14,530
I'll have you torn apart
and thrown to the dogs.

233
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,130
I'm his son, I can say anything,

234
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,210
not you!

235
00:18:24,290 --> 00:18:25,290
Bhaiyaji...

236
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:28,730
Bhaiyaji, let it go.

237
00:18:29,530 --> 00:18:31,090
He's drunk.

238
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,170
Why don't we call
those two assholes here?

239
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,050
Fuck with them.

240
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:41,810
[reciting poetry]

241
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,050
[reciting poetry]

242
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,250
Did you know this was
Mahadevi's first poem?

243
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,890
And she wrote this when
she was only 6 years old!

244
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,410
Here you go.

245
00:18:57,730 --> 00:18:58,730
What is this?

246
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:00,690
Why are you charging extra?

247
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,130
You had a patty earlier today,

248
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,050
and ran off without paying, remember?

249
00:19:04,530 --> 00:19:05,530
Just added that here.

250
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:11,850
Th... there's been some confusion.

251
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:13,450
I'll just go sort it out.

252
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,690
What the fuck, kid? Huh?

253
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:20,930
You'll take money from me?

254
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,050
Do you know who I am?

255
00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:23,410
What difference will that make?

256
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,770
Do you know who I am?

257
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:26,290
No, right?

258
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:29,890
And anyway, if paying just fifty
bucks is making you shit your pants,

259
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:31,570
you're surely a fraud.

260
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,850
- Fucker, I'll...
- What happened?

261
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,170
He gave me a bill, the little fuck.

262
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,530
Here.

263
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,410
And my tip?

264
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:44,890
At least 10%.

265
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:47,290
You didn't even order anything

266
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,730
and took up an entire table.

267
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,770
You're right.

268
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,770
What happened?

269
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,250
Nothing, it's sorted.

270
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:01,410
Tipped him too.

271
00:20:05,490 --> 00:20:07,130
Shall we go for a
movie next time, Sweety?

272
00:20:08,330 --> 00:20:09,490
It'll be a 3-hour date,

273
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:11,610
more time together.

274
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,490
If it's a Salman Khan movie, I'll come.

275
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,210
I'll take you to Shilpi
Talkies, it's fantastic.

276
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:20,770
Hello?

277
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,050
Munna bhaiya?

278
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:26,490
Yeah.

279
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:28,770
Okay.

280
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:35,010
Munna bhaiya has summoned us.

281
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:38,370
Fuck this.

282
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:39,730
What a drag.

283
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,610
Hmm.

284
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:48,570
Come, kids.

285
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:50,330
Come, come.

286
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:57,130
Come.

287
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:10,530
Is that a present for me?

288
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:20,890
Why so serious?

289
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,330
You were handpicked.

290
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,690
Thought you could chill with us.

291
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:28,690
Lalit,

292
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,690
make a nice, strong one for them both.

293
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:32,090
I don't drink.

294
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,250
Neither do I.

295
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:36,810
Drinking together is a mark of loyalty.

296
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,650
You're loyal, aren't you?

297
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,010
Hmm?

298
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:54,170
Are you or not?

299
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,290
Huh, huh?

300
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:58,890
Relax, you guys.

301
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,250
Hmm?

302
00:22:05,650 --> 00:22:07,490
I hear you want to become a bodybuilder.

303
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:09,370
Yes, bhaiyaji. I'm trying.

304
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,490
Don't feel bad, but...

305
00:22:17,010 --> 00:22:18,130
your body isn't good enough.

306
00:22:21,130 --> 00:22:22,130
How will you do it?

307
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:24,530
I'll improve my diet.

308
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,450
That's why I'd asked
you for eggs that day.

309
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,170
Just eggs won't cut it.

310
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,210
What were you talking
about Compounder? Tell us.

311
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,490
Yeah, that...

312
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:35,490
For bodybuilding,

313
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,610
you get all these supplements.

314
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,250
Your muscles

315
00:22:39,410 --> 00:22:41,450
will become rock-hard.

316
00:22:41,650 --> 00:22:43,290
Yes, I'd read about that on the net.

317
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:45,450
I have some lying around.

318
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:47,450
You want? It's free.

319
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:49,290
- Guddu bhaiya.
- Hold on, man.

320
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:51,530
Well, why wait on a good deed?

321
00:22:51,890 --> 00:22:53,530
Let's get him the pills right now.

322
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:55,010
Yeah, let's.

323
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:04,730
Here.

324
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,610
Take two everyday.

325
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,970
Keep in mind,

326
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:13,090
you'll be very hungry.

327
00:23:13,370 --> 00:23:17,290
And very horny.

328
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,090
So, be careful.

329
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,410
You can get some more later.

330
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,730
Stronger ones.

331
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:28,170
Start with these.

332
00:23:28,770 --> 00:23:30,410
I wanted to ask...

333
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:32,610
I read this on the net...

334
00:23:33,650 --> 00:23:35,690
another thing that's
good for big muscles is

335
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:39,490
mother's milk.

336
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,970
I mean, is there any way to...

337
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:55,770
No, it's true.

338
00:23:57,930 --> 00:23:59,170
Have you lost it, man?

339
00:23:59,250 --> 00:24:00,250
Huh?

340
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,530
Go on, now.

341
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:17,610
Dimpy!

342
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:18,850
Yes, Papa?

343
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:20,330
Have they come?

344
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:21,650
Yes, Papa.

345
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,370
Make some tea, please.

346
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,490
Okay.

347
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:31,330
My apologies, I got held up in court.

348
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,490
Just give me a moment.

349
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:36,650
Then we can talk properly.

350
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,170
I had some more
questions about the case.

351
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:40,930
Have some water.

352
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,930
I can't look him in the eye.

353
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:03,210
You?

354
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,610
Yes.

355
00:25:06,210 --> 00:25:07,530
We're Mr Pandit's sons.

356
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,450
We... we've come to withdraw the case.

357
00:25:12,890 --> 00:25:15,410
Good. Leave the letter and fuck off.

358
00:25:28,010 --> 00:25:29,010
Sir.

359
00:25:30,210 --> 00:25:31,210
We'll take your leave.

360
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,450
We're leaving this letter for you.

361
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:37,730
- Please read it.
- I'll read the letter, but... please sit.

362
00:25:42,210 --> 00:25:44,010
No, thank you.

363
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:47,090
But...

364
00:25:54,130 --> 00:25:55,466
Did the two of you
say something to them?

365
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,490
What would we have said?

366
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,610
Mummy! Move aside.

367
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:01,210
Mummy!

368
00:26:11,330 --> 00:26:12,850
Well, do you like it or not?

369
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:14,570
I like it very much.

370
00:26:14,650 --> 00:26:15,650
How much did it cost?

371
00:26:16,610 --> 00:26:19,090
It's a gift, Mum. You
don't need to know.

372
00:26:19,290 --> 00:26:20,290
Yes, but still.

373
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,570
Stop acting so middle-class.

374
00:26:23,690 --> 00:26:25,170
Kaaleen bhaiya paid us.

375
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,290
Oi, Dimpy!

376
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:30,010
He gave you such an
amazing motorcycle too.

377
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,930
That's why I had it blessed.

378
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:35,050
You called, bhaiya?

379
00:26:35,290 --> 00:26:36,730
Yes, I called.

380
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:41,010
We got this for you.

381
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:47,930
I'm on Papa's side.

382
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:49,050
I won't take this.

383
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:54,370
What do you mean "side"?

384
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,450
We're a divided family now, bhaiya.

385
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,930
And those clients downstairs,
they withdrew their case.

386
00:27:01,290 --> 00:27:02,810
And they're ignoring Papa's calls.

387
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:20,170
We got a suit for Papa.

388
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:22,530
He hasn't bought anything
for himself in years.

389
00:27:23,170 --> 00:27:25,050
- So, we did.
- Wow.

390
00:27:26,850 --> 00:27:28,410
I'm not even sure he'll take it.

391
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,450
You give it to him.

392
00:27:33,370 --> 00:27:34,370
Okay.

393
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,770
I should go, dinner is almost ready.

394
00:27:38,290 --> 00:27:39,290
Thank you.

395
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,090
I love it.

396
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:50,530
Guddu bhaiya, why are you taking this?

397
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,490
Just giving it a try, bro.

398
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:55,530
Let's see.

399
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,930
S...

400
00:28:02,450 --> 00:28:05,050
S... side? What does she mean?

401
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:07,370
What... what is going on here? Huh?

402
00:28:18,770 --> 00:28:20,650
What you said about Papa earlier...

403
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,850
I shouldn't have, Munna bhaiya.

404
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:24,770
Sorry.

405
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:28,850
Will you go the
distance when it matters?

406
00:28:34,890 --> 00:28:36,410
I will, Munna bhaiya.

407
00:29:07,130 --> 00:29:09,300
Dimpy said that Guddu and Bablu

408
00:29:09,301 --> 00:29:11,130
are now working full-time
for Kaaleen bhaiya,

409
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,850
they barely even attend college.

410
00:29:14,290 --> 00:29:15,290
Oh?

411
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,090
Both of them?

412
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:18,250
Hmm.

413
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,530
I think they did the right thing.

414
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:25,930
There's no harm in working for
the most powerful man in town.

415
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,330
Hmm?

416
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:31,810
Best not to judge.

417
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,090
One man's virtue...

418
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:37,570
... can be another's vice, no?

419
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:14,130
Kaaleen bhaiya,

420
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:20,130
in your legit business front
what sort of profit do you make?

421
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:23,610
Enough to pay the bills, Guddu.

422
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:26,370
You seem eager to know
all about my profits.

423
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:27,530
Nothing like that.

424
00:30:27,890 --> 00:30:29,210
Prove your worth first.

425
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,970
Alright?

426
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,650
Let's go.

427
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:48,810
We've got the world at our
feet, and it's been so easy.

428
00:31:04,970 --> 00:31:07,330
The supplier took some persuading...

429
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,050
... before he was amenable.

430
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,490
He'll give us more silk...

431
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:13,730
but...

432
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,810
he's hiked the price.

433
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:18,810
If we're buying more,

434
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:21,170
the rates should be lesser, no?

435
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:24,690
Young man, talk to your father.

436
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:32,170
How much does he want?

437
00:31:33,170 --> 00:31:34,170
15% more.

438
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:48,930
Yes.

439
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:51,810
Papa, we'll get the 'silk', but...

440
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:56,810
Lala has increased the rate by 25%

441
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:04,730
Dad, I barely convinced Lala.

442
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,130
He was being adamant.

443
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,690
Don't get into the negotiation.

444
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:10,050
Just give me the go ahead.

445
00:32:12,090 --> 00:32:13,090
Alright.

446
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:15,650
Then I'm finalizing the deal.

447
00:32:17,130 --> 00:32:18,130
Yes.

448
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:33,730
Tell me, Mr Tripathi.

449
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:38,930
No, no, no. Not less than 25%

450
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:42,810
Any lesser, and I'll be taking a hit.

451
00:32:43,770 --> 00:32:45,770
Of course, if I could, I would.

452
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:52,690
You're quite the bastard, son.

453
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,610
You see,

454
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,170
if you expand the gun business,

455
00:33:02,770 --> 00:33:04,450
I'll involve you in this too.

456
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:08,170
Consider it an incentive.

457
00:33:11,130 --> 00:33:13,970
So, if you're not letting
us in on the business,

458
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,570
then why did you bring us here?

459
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,850
You're sharp.

460
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,770
But learn to be patient.

461
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,450
Maqbool.

462
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,690
Ever whacked somebody?

463
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,650
Yeah, course, that day at the house.

464
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,490
- We whacked the shit outta them.
- Killed.

465
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,130
Have you ever killed someone?

466
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,210
Your time has come.

467
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:28,570
Got your guns, right?

468
00:34:30,930 --> 00:34:31,930
Sir...

469
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:34,090
Shut up.

470
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,210
Am I talking to you?

471
00:34:37,770 --> 00:34:38,810
They're being trained.

472
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:45,130
Go on.

473
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:46,530
Shoot.

474
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,210
Shoot.

475
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,090
Shoot, man!

476
00:35:12,010 --> 00:35:13,050
Please!

477
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:19,250
Please let me go.

478
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:21,370
What have I ever done to you?

479
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,610
Pl... please... let me go.

480
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:32,770
Shoot him in the head or the heart.

481
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,410
Let me go.

482
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,130
I'm begging you.

483
00:35:43,490 --> 00:35:45,810
Motherfucker.

484
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,010
Wrong side,

485
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,890
the heart is on the left.

486
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:02,450
Fucking cuntflaps.

487
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:34,010
Today, you boys have become men.

488
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:36,810
Consider your cherry popped.

489
00:37:52,570 --> 00:37:53,970
There's a method to murder.

490
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,610
The less you know about them,

491
00:37:58,570 --> 00:37:59,970
the easier it is.

492
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:01,410
Otherwise...

493
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,170
you will hesitate on the trigger.

494
00:38:06,850 --> 00:38:11,850
Now, your next task is to
transport these carpets out of town.

495
00:38:13,730 --> 00:38:17,050
And, remember... you can't use
Kaaleen bhaiya's or my name.

496
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:33,050
In the beginning, I had a brain freeze.

497
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,410
But then... after that first shot,

498
00:38:38,610 --> 00:38:39,610
it was easy.

499
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:45,250
Oi, Bablu!

500
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:47,450
Why are you so quiet?

501
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,690
I shat my pants in there.

502
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:06,210
I don't think I can do this again.

503
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:10,250
Alright...

504
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,810
from now on, I'll use the gun,

505
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:14,050
and you, your mind.

506
00:39:14,610 --> 00:39:15,810
It's sorted.

507
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,290
Motherfucker.

508
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:47,890
Bablu.

509
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,090
Hide it!

510
00:39:56,250 --> 00:39:57,970
- What's in the truck?
- Carpets, sir.

511
00:39:58,130 --> 00:39:59,210
Get out, show me.

512
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,450
Sir, they're just carpets.

513
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:01,890
I said, show me.

514
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:03,010
Coming.

515
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,410
Hurry up.

516
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:23,570
Fuck!

517
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:28,970
Open up.

518
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,850
Shit!

519
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,410
Open up.

520
00:40:46,530 --> 00:40:47,530
Open up.

521
00:40:48,610 --> 00:40:50,090
What's taking so long, man?

522
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,290
Open up!

523
00:40:53,330 --> 00:40:54,330
Open up!

524
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,000
