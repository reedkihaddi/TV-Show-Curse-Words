Yes, sir.

What took you so long?

7
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:22,780
Sir, I'd dropped off.

00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,940
Didn't you show him the papers?

What's this?

10
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,940
Sir, some idiot left a jerry
can on top of the carpets.

11
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,700
It toppled, wet the carpets,
and they all bled color.

Move it.

If you'd opened up a second
later, that guy would be dead.

You've been hogging it for ages.

There's work to be done.

It's just bad luck.

00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,820
I seem to get all the fraud guns.

43
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:44,180
They explode or get jammed.

44
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:47,260
The customers keep returning them.

45
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,340
And then I gotta return their money.

46

Sorry,

51

we don't have traditional sweets

52
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,060
so she's just served sugar.

54
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:27,180
- Mum and Dad...
- No, not yours, your wife's family.

55
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,300
She's from Jaunpur, no?

Hmm?

58

- Yes.
- Right.

59
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,140
We got a hold of your call records.

60
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,140
You must really love chatting
to your brother-in-law.

Once a week, he delivers
a trunk and takes one back.

What's in those trunks?

64
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,900
It's just household stuff.

65
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,460
These guns seem perfectly fine.

66
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,740
So, he gets you fraud guns from Jaunpur

67
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,340
and you sell our good guns to him.

68

Too much banter, too little time.

- Yeah, and I got this.

- What's this?
- Breast milk, remember?

restructure the deals
with the gun distributors

98

and update the standard

They don't smoke, less of a hazard.

Listen up, fellows.

I've decided to implement a new system.

136
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:59,100

You're head of quality
assurance, Mr Upadhyay,

168
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,380
they won't explode if
you've done your job.

169
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:06,660
Pick up one of the cheaper ones.

170
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:21,820
Wait.

171
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,940
You're right-handed, no?

172
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,420
Why're you aiming with your left hand?

173
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,820
How about this...

174
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:40,180
pick another gun in your right hand.

175
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,380
Let's test two in one
go, much more efficient.

176
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,220
Here, grab another one.

177
00:17:57,020 --> 00:17:59,180
Go on, aim.

178
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,660
- Sir...
- Go for it!

179
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,660
If you use genuine truck
parts they shouldn't explode.

180
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:26,580
And yet they do, why?

181
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,460
Hmm?

182
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:37,140
Investigate thoroughly,
you'll find the problem.

183
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:42,700
And until you do, this is how
we'll do our "quality assurance".

184
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Okay?

185
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,660
Later, then.

186
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:00,940
Motherfuckers, do you
guys wanna have a go?

187
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,900
Get out, beat it!

188
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:12,660
I can't sell you the
truck parts anymore.

189
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:18,860
Can't grease my palm if I
don't have fucking hands!

190
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,020
The cuntflaps, they were
making me test the guns.

191
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,660
Thank you.

192
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,540
Mr Pandit, how many more
letters will you write?

193
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:42,820
The violence is getting worse,
the town will implode at this rate.

194
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,860
Well, who'd know better than you?

195
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,740
I hear it's your boys who're
causing this whole ruckus.

196
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:07,100
You're my friend, I've
watched your kids grow up.

197
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:09,980
I hope you can stop them.

198
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:12,460
You know what I mean, right?

199
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,540
Back again, Munna bhaiya?

200
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,660
Do the honors then.

201
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:47,660
Nice, come on, bro.

202
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,180
You're gonna love this snack.

203
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,660
Subodh!

204
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,940
Do you want something to eat?

205
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,300
Your friends must be hungry.

206
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:59,180
No, Grandma, we're fine.

207
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,340
We're discussing some business.

208
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,260
You should sleep.

209
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,460
Okay.

210
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,580
Your grandma's really fucking cute.

211
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:18,020
That's why I love her so much.

212
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,060
They look expensive, Golu.

213
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:36,420
Return them if it
makes you uncomfortable.

214
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,540
I'm not uncomfortable, I just...

215
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,940
you won't get it until
it happens to you.

216
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:44,780
Guddu seems serious.

217
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,980
I hope you are too.

218
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:51,020
Otherwise he'll be heartbroken.

219
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:54,740
I want to be serious,
but what about Papa?

220
00:21:56,860 --> 00:22:00,420
If you are serious I'll talk to Papa.

221
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,420
Whatever happens you
know I have your back.

222
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
Golu, duck.

223
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,340
Two cream sorbets.

224
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,820
So pretty.

225
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:37,260
The earrings or I?

226
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,420
The earrings, because of you.

227
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm a straightforward guy, Sweety.

228
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:00,820
I gave you a gift, you accepted it.

229
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,660
This is getting serious.

230
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:08,300
So, I wanted to be honest with you.

231
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:17,620
I'm a gangster.

232
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:21,740
I have my own reasons for that,

233
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,660
but if you wish to return
the earrings do so now.

234
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,380
I'll understand.

235
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:42,140
I'm fairly straightforward too, Guddu.

236
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,020
Why should I return the earrings?

237
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:48,060
They suit me, you said so yourself.

238
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:10,620
Guns don't scare me. Been
around them since I was a kid.

239
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,860
Just...

240
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,980
you'll be careful, won't you?

241
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,820
With myself, and you.

242
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:46,460
So, you're saying I can wear the
clothes right out of the machine?

243
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:49,660
You need to dry them a bit,
but this is the top-end model.

244
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:51,940
Where's Dimpy?

245
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,620
She's gone to a friend's for some notes.

246
00:24:54,180 --> 00:24:56,940
You know it's not safe here
at night and you still...

247
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,580
Don't worry, papa.

248
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:01,100
I'd like to see someone
lay a finger on Dimpy.

249
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,140
Oh, yes, I'd forgotten

250
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:05,916
she's protected by
Michael and Sunny Corleone.

251
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,140
Papa, please stop.

252
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,700
we're just starting to
enjoy the fruits of...

253
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,316
And what will you do
with all these "fruits"?

254
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,220
At the end of day, you'll
still be eating bread.

255
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,100
Yes, but at least we
can have it with chicken.

256
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,020
I'm done here, sir.

257
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,740
Have some please.

258
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,020
You have it, should I
pass you the chicken?

259
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,180
Gonna hit 200 today.

260
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,980
I feel strong. Pumped.

261
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,700
... 140,

262
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,020
Oh man, don't start again.

263
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:41,100
... 142, 143, 144, 145,146, 147,

264
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,940
These are Mirzapur's history-sheeters...

265
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,180
kidnappers,

266
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,820
chain snatchers,

267
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,100
musclemen,

268
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,180
thieves.

269
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,100
Mirzapur's most notorious.

270
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,660
Tell them.

271
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,020
Sir,

272
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,500
is there a problem?

273
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,460
We make sure to give
Kaaleen bhaiya the money

274
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:14,180
along with our loyalty.

275
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,860
You're loyal, that's why
we've called you here.

276
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,620
Look,

277
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,860
our job is to make homespun guns

278
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,620
and yours is to fire them.

279
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,860
Right?

280
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:31,460
If we stop making the
guns, what will you fire?

281
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,620
Fuck all?

282
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,740
And if we don't fire them then
what will you do after making them?

283
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,980
Fuck all.

284
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,420
Bravo!

285
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:52,740
So, in order to survive
we need each other.

286
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,900
We want to increase the
homespun gun production

287
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:59,780
so you'll have to fire them more.

288
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,100
We can only fire the guns we have

289
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,260
and many of us don't even have guns.

290
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:08,940
And if we solve this problem of yours?

291
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,780
Well, then...

292
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Alright.

293
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:20,020
Take your pick.

294
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,220
But how do we pay for these?

295
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:23,860
They're free.

296
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,940
Take whatever you want.

297
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,900
If this is not enough,
there's always more.

298
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,220
Earn what you can with these.

299
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,620
But remember,

300
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,340
keep the guns firing.

301
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,460
Yes, sir.

302
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Also, it's possible that the
police might apprehend you.

303
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:58,660
But you won't be hassled, I promise you.

304
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
Yes, sir.

305
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,100
Later, then.

306
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:10,860
Mirzapur is quiet these
days go and make some noise.

307
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:14,540
Just watch, sir we'll be
celebrating Diwali soon.

308
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,620
Let's go.

309
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,620
Guns for free, something
you just decided?

310
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,660
What if it doesn't work out?

311
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,700
Shouldn't you have
checked with me first?

312
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:36,100
Kaaleen bhaiya was in
the loop, Munna bhaiya.

313
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,340
Just be patient, I'm
sure we'll get results.

314
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,580
Right now, we've just
increased the supply.

315
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,820
Once they've tasted blood,

316
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,980
their demands will increase,
and so will our prices.

317
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:52,140
You just tell the factory
workers to get ready for overtime.

318
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:05,980
Sir, these boys are ruining everything.

319
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm well aware, Usman.

320
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,340
It's Papa's call

321
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:18,460
so be patient.

322
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:20,340
- Yes, sir.
- I'll think of something.

323
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Okay.

324
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
We'll speak later.

325
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,300
Hey, Compounder.

326
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Hmm?

327
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,460
The whole town is running amok with guns

328
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,700
and you're still using that damn razor.

329
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,140
Munna bhaiya,

330
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,140
there is poetry in the razor's blade.

331
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,020
The "khchh" when it
pierces skin and flesh

332
00:29:57,700 --> 00:30:00,100
that's what makes the
kill visceral; real.

333
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:07,420
You're talking like a bloody lover.

334
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:16,500
Just one, neat slice
and the magic unfolds...

335
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:20,300
spitting blood from his throat,

336
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:23,100
his mouth frozen, unable to scream,

337
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:29,180
the blood spattering
in beautiful patterns,

338
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:35,580
death becomes poetry;
poetry becomes death.

339
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:48,860
I need to piss.

340
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,100
I'll be back.

341
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,580
I'll come too.

342
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,220
Bravo!

343
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,860
This is true friendship,

344
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,820
we even piss together.

345
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:06,580
Hmm.

346
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,380
Let's go.

347
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:13,820
But...

348
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,820
we'll each hold our own, eh?

349
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,540
Ey, motherfucker.

350
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,980
What the fuck, huh?

351
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,300
Clean this.

352
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:37,060
It's just some piss, man.

353
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:39,140
Motherfucker.

354
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,580
You trying to tell me what it is?

355
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,100
No, no, you're overreacting.

356
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,820
What did you say, cuntlicker?

357
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,580
Munna bhaiya is overreacting?

358
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,020
No, I...

359
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,540
Go on, lick it.

360
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:56,740
Hang on

361
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,580
can't just piss on me and leave.

362
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:04,420
Munna bhaiya, let's fuck him up. Here.

363
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,300
Do it, do it.

364
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,860
Be still.

365
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,140
Be still, it's my first time.

366
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,340
Hold him.

367
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,140
Give it to me. I'll show you how...

368
00:32:41,820 --> 00:32:45,140
on his throat, and...

369
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,140
You were right, Compounder

370
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,980
about the poetry razor shit.

371
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:21,580
Just give me the word and

372
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:24,220
I'll give you another
demo whenever you want it.

373
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,180
I'm your friend

374
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,220
a friend in deed.

375
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,940
Time to piss.

376
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:43,940
Listen,

377
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,340
come here.

378
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,140
You know what, Compounder?

379
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
Yes?

380
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,700
In all of Mirzapur, no one
knows me better than you.

381
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,140
Well, there was my mum...

382
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:04,900
just you now.

383
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,780
Don't ever fuck me over, man.

384
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:18,500
Haseena, you lead the tranny gang, yeah?

385
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:20,220
That's why I'm asking you.

386
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:23,140
Take it, sir, I'm not stopping you.

387
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,860
Dip your hand in here
and take the money.

388
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:29,620
Don't you know begging is illegal?

389
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,660
Are we the only people doing
illegal things in this town, sir?

390
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:34,500
What about the rest, huh?

391
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:37,180
- Wait, sir!
- Why are you leaving?

392
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,700
Hire me as a constable,

393
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:42,980
I won't beg then, my
pride matters to me too.

394
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,780
Where are you going, motherfuckers?

395
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,940
Cuntflaps.

396
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,820
Oh look here, Sakina, Jasmine...

397
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:53,300
Ah ha!

398
00:34:53,580 --> 00:34:55,500
Hello, Bablu bhaiya, Guddu bhaiya.

399
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,660
Hello.

400
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,820
You know us?

401
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,780
Anything that happens in this
town, we get to hear of it first,

402
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,660
our network is solid.

403
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,700
Of course we know you.

404
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:07,940
Here.

405
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:14,260
May God bless you.

406
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:16,780
Come Jasmine, let's go.

407
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,660
Here's 500.

408
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:24,460
People recognize us now, eh...

409
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:28,620
Mummy!

410
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:29,860
Yes?

411
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,660
What the...

412
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,420
we got you a washing machine
and you're not using it?

413
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,020
I'm washing your father's clothes.

414
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:41,540
- Why?
- Because I told her to.

415
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,740
My clothes will not go in that machine.

416
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:45,620
Why are you behaving like this, Papa?

417
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:46,700
No, no.

418
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:50,580
This town might be yours

419
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,020
but this house is still mine.

420
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:57,180
Papa, we can't get into this every day.

421
00:35:57,540 --> 00:35:59,620
Just tell us what you
want and we'll do it.

422
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,940
You know what I want.

423
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,340
That's impossible.

424
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:06,660
At first we didn't have a choice

425
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,340
but now we're enjoying it.

426
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,900
Okay, listen...

427
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,780
- those curtains you liked?
- Hmm.

428
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:24,860
Go buy them

429
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,380
and tell Dimpy to buy some new jeans.

430
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,260
I'll tell her I got them
otherwise she won't take them.

431
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:35,740
I wanted to talk to you about something.

432
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,740
You know, the grocer

433
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:39,420
we go to for our rations?

434
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:43,060
I don't like the way he talks to me,

435
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,420
there's a certain lack of respect.

436
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:49,700
Shall we straighten him out?

437
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,660
Do you have your gun?

438
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:55,820
Alright.

439
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,300
I'll get ready.

440
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,180
- Alright.
- I'll wear that saree.

441
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:04,540
Yes.

442
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:12,820
What are you doing, bro?

443
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,100
She's Guddu and Bablu's mother, man.

444
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,956
She has to be treated with respect.

445
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,220
Yes, but you can just chat, why the gun?

446
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:23,540
Ugh.

447
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:27,140
Because I can.

448
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,460
This is the good life.

449
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:57,820
- Well, if it isn't my favorite priestess...
- Hmm.

450
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:58,900
Well?

451
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,460
How's everything going for you, Guddu?

452
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:04,100
I'm doing great.

453
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:06,060
As for you, we'll know soon enough.

454
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,660
Guddu! Guddu!

455
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:19,860
Guddu, no!

456
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,620
I'll smash all your fingers

457
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,940
and put a bullet in your skull. Got it?

458
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,500
I'm not that young, lanky Guddu anymore.

459
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:37,380
My mother warrants respect.

460
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:40,860
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

461
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:43,820
What the fuck is this
"priestess" nonsense?

462
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:54,460
You could've just told me, Mrs Pandit.

463
00:38:57,860 --> 00:38:59,020
I understand!

464
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,860
I understand, Guddu bhaiya

465
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,860
and your groceries for
this month are free!

466
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,020
For the entire year, free!

467
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,180
Free for life!

468
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,300
Hey, listen!

469
00:39:24,860 --> 00:39:26,400
Even after I die the Pandit household

470
00:39:26,401 --> 00:39:30,540
won't pay for groceries, understood?

471
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:46,140
Anything else I can do, Mrs Pandit?

472
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,820
How much for this?

473
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:11,540
Guddu Pandit.

474
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,740
Bablu Pandit.

475
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,660
If you want to live in this town

476
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,780
remember these names, arseholes.

477
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:26,140
I'm telling you right now.

478
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,460
Mirzapur will run at our command.

479
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:24,620
Sir, you're bleeding us dry while
handing out free guns to those goons.

480
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:28,300
Just be patient, Usman.

481
00:41:28,940 --> 00:41:30,980
Your profits will multiply tenfold.

482
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:49,580
My child!

483
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,940
Get out.

484
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,260
... file an FIR for your
measly stolen belongings?

485
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,380
But...

486
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,540
It's your life, and property, right?

487
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:09,980
Be fucking responsible for it.

488
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,700
Once fear grips this town

489
00:42:13,820 --> 00:42:15,400
it won't be just the
goons who'll need guns.

490
00:42:15,401 --> 00:42:18,300
The innocent will need guns too.

491
00:42:18,380 --> 00:42:20,060
Guns for attack,

492
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,780
guns for defence.

493
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:24,500
We'll turn Mirzapur into America.

494
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:59,660
Come on, give me the money.

495
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,660
This month's crime
rate has fallen, right?

496
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:26,420
Since we don't report any crimes.

497
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,740
I've been thinking,

498
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:49,260
we should get Guddu and Bablu
into the "carpet" business.

499
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,420
They've done good work,

500
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:55,820
the balance of brains
and brawn is productive.

501
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:58,540
May I say something, Kaaleen bhaiya?

502
00:43:58,940 --> 00:43:59,980
Hmm?

503
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:02,420
Guddu and Bablu have shot up quickly.

504
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,460
I think

505
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:09,420
Munna is feeling sidelined.

506
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:12,180
Munna is an idiot, to feel like that.

507
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:17,300
After all, eventually
the business will be his.

508
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:28,580
[Lucknow, Uttar Pradesh]

509
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,060
Easy on the chillies next time, please.

510
00:44:40,500 --> 00:44:43,300
The government will ask us to
account for every ounce of spice.

511
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:44,820
Ah, you remembered, sir.

512
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:47,900
Well, to get you to do something

513
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,260
I know it won't happen
without some ice-cream first.

514
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,180
Ugh, strawberry.

515
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,660
Step up from vanilla, my man.

516
00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:00,740
Try it.

517
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,700
How is it?

518
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:10,300
Mindblowing, sir.

519
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:16,340
So, Maurya

520
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:20,380
there's bloodshed in Mirzapur

521
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,940
and with elections around the corner,

522
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,780
Lucknow is panicked.

523
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,020
The bosses have commanded
you be sent to Mirzapur.

524
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,420
Yes, sir.

525
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,820
If you've got a cold, don't have it.

526
00:45:45,700 --> 00:45:47,220
Sir, we're policemen.

527
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,060
What's a little
sweetener here and there?

528
00:45:50,020 --> 00:45:51,140
Right then.

529
00:45:51,740 --> 00:45:54,420
Go, clean up the city.

530
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,380
[By Government Order]

531
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,900
Off you go.
