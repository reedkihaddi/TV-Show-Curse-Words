2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:08,810
Grab him! Grab him!

3
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:10,650
Don't let him go!

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,850
Grab him! Grab him!

5
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:15,530
Pin him down!

6
00:00:18,450 --> 00:00:20,850
Bravo!

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,010
This is no fun, Tripathi.

8
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:26,610
Let's wager on it.

9
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:29,610
20,000 on Baggi.

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:31,810
You're on, Mr Yadav.

11
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:33,970
My guy is... What's his name?

12
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,770
- Uh... Raaka! Raaka.
- Raaka. I'll bet 20 too.

13
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:40,210
Your lad's got spunk, Tripathi.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,770
- Come on, start.
- Yes, yes.

15
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,890
Alright, start.

16
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,410
Yes, come on, Baggi!

17
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:50,450
Grab his leg, Raaka!

18
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:51,890
I've put money on you.

19
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:55,970
- Bravo!
- Go Raaka!

20
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,250
If you lose, I'll fuck you in the ass!

21
00:00:58,370 --> 00:00:59,370
Bravo!

22
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:04,650
Bravo!

23
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,170
Did you see, Papa?
Just like Salman Khan.

24
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,610
Go, Raaka! Bravo, my lion.

25
00:01:20,690 --> 00:01:23,250
Bravo, bravo! Excellent.

26
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:27,010
Come on, you got this!

27
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:36,570
- Bravo!
- Throw him!

28
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,850
Yes!

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:40,610
Bravo!

30
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,210
Hold him!

31
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,130
- Get a grip!
- Yes!

32
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,410
Flip him over, turn, Raaka!

33
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:53,370
Turn, turn! Don't let him up!

34
00:01:53,930 --> 00:01:54,970
Keep him pinned!

35
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:58,330
Ey, motherfucker, are you a moron?

36
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:03,970
See that?

37
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,730
Baggi won!

38
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,370
Well, Munna? Wasn't that fun?

39
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:12,850
He destroyed him. I never
lose. Now gimme my money.

40
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:16,730
You're our guest after
all, you ought to win.

41
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:22,850
Come now.

42
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,210
Let's get on with the real
reason we're here, the sit-down.

43
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,730
Yes, let's go.

44
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,330
Come.

45
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:35,850
Sir!

46
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,010
I wanted to formally invite you

47
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,810
and you must come...

48
00:02:40,010 --> 00:02:42,490
don't forget, you're our Chief Guest...

49
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,626
for the Mr Purvanchal
bodybuilding contest.

50
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,770
- Yes, yes.
- Please do come.

51
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:46,770
- Make it grand!
- Yes, sir.

52
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,850
How're your studies going?

53
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,730
Not much studying happening,
but the fucking's going well.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:56,890
So, gentlemen, this was the
main reason for the sit-down.

55
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,370
Elections are almost upon us.

56
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:01,850
So, the violence must be... controlled.

57
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:05,210
Not because the public needs to be safe.

58
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,410
But because they need to feel safe.

59
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,170
That's when they vote
for the incumbent party.

60
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:18,330
Somebody explain this
to Rati Shankar Shukla.

61
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,290
What happened?

62
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:25,610
Where are you going?

63
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:27,130
Check, will you?

64
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,650
Going for a piss. You wanna
come along and hold it?

65
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,130
You can't make an omelette
without breaking some eggs.

66
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,290
We have to send you the money.

67
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:47,250
So, there will be some violence.

68
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,810
Sure, but keep it controlled.

69
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,050
More money, less violence.

70
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,090
The Chief Minister's image
shouldn't be tarnished.

71
00:03:58,090 --> 00:03:59,090
Munna,

72
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,810
have the money put in his car.

73
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,010
Jai hind, sir!

74
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,170
This way, sir.

75
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:54,890
Your office.

76
00:05:31,690 --> 00:05:32,690
Jai hind, sir!

77
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,050
May I come in? I am Parshuram Gupta.

78
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,530
Yes, yes, Mr Gupta. Come in.

79
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,850
I've been waiting on you.

80
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,570
Sir. Chetan. Akram.

81
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,530
Please have a seat, sir.

82
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,170
Yes, I'd like to. I am
quite tired from the journey.

83
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:50,810
But the room's so dusty,
my uniform will get dirty.

84
00:05:51,010 --> 00:05:52,010
Rapan!

85
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,090
Yes, sir?

86
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,730
Sorry sir, it's...

87
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:56,930
Don't be sorry.

88
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,610
It's just that a clean environment
inspires you to work better.

89
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:04,570
Dust the officer's room!

90
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,650
Come, come.

91
00:06:06,770 --> 00:06:10,450
So, I read the report on Mirzapur.

92
00:06:10,930 --> 00:06:12,730
You guys seem to be
running a tight ship here.

93
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:15,621
So why's the media filling up

94
00:06:15,622 --> 00:06:17,690
pages with stories of
crime and corruption?

95
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:22,330
Oh no sir, just the stray incident,

96
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,370
and we caught them all too,

97
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,370
just that there wasn't enough
evidence, so we had to let them off.

98
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:30,890
And the media just
loves to fuck with us.

99
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:38,730
Tell me something.

100
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:42,170
You sure you aren't
trying to fuck with me too?

101
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,050
I mean...

102
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:49,090
if there's any extra cash to be
made, you'll let me know, won't you?

103
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,730
Anyway,

104
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,570
I hear there's a mafia
conclave in Mirzapur today.

105
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,386
There you go looking worried again.

106
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:05,650
I'm not saying it's a problem.

107
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,450
Holi is a festive occasion after
all, there will be visitors.

108
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:14,610
- Alright, off you go.
- Yes, sir! Come.

109
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:27,530
[singing a folk song]

110
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,690
Hello, Maqbool.

111
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:35,090
How are you?

112
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:37,370
I'm well

113
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,290
and secure.

114
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,970
I have something for you.

115
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,410
A, B, C, D...

116
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,991
You make your victims
recite the Hindi alphabet

117
00:09:03,992 --> 00:09:04,992
before you kill them, no?

118
00:09:05,370 --> 00:09:07,850
How about I ask your son, Sharad

119
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,130
to recite the Urdu alphabet?

120
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,250
Any chance he'd know it?

121
00:09:35,170 --> 00:09:37,490
No more intrusions into Mirzapur.

122
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,410
Sharad must not be harmed, Maqbool.

123
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:51,170
So what if Holi is four days later?

124
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:54,170
We're celebrating it today.

125
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:56,690
Come, give me a hug.

126
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,530
Your hands are stained.

127
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:26,250
Ah, Zarina's here. Let the fun begin!

128
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,650
Oh, this heart of mine.

129
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:44,450
It's crazy about love.

130
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,850
Crazy, oh so crazy.

131
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:51,770
Drawn like a moth to love's flame.

132
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,850
Oh, I know very well.

133
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:59,290
The feel of love's burn.

134
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,010
Don't even bother trying, beloved.

135
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:06,050
You can't escape.

136
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:09,850
Oh, this heart of mine.

137
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:13,050
It's crazy about love.

138
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,930
Oh, this heart of mine.

139
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:19,490
It's crazy about love.

140
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:42,410
Oh, this heart wants.

141
00:11:42,570 --> 00:11:46,050
And it gets whoever it wants.

142
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:53,050
I'd sacrifice myself just upon
the mention of my beloved's name.

143
00:11:53,170 --> 00:12:00,050
Oh, this heart wants. And
it gets whoever it wants.

144
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:03,175
A true lover who would sacrifice himself

145
00:12:03,176 --> 00:12:06,410
just upon the mention
of the beloved's name.

146
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:12,810
I take a life in exchange for mine.

147
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:16,570
Oh, this heart of mine.

148
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,530
It's crazy about love.

149
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:23,610
Crazy, oh so crazy.

150
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:27,050
Drawn like a moth to love's flame.

151
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,170
What the hell, huh?

152
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:51,290
Stop the music, motherfucker!

153
00:12:53,290 --> 00:12:54,290
Munna!

154
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,090
What?

155
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:10,290
Go on, leave.

156
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:11,650
Raja.

157
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:14,850
Take him away.

158
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:28,530
How could you slap Munna
in front of everybody?

159
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:29,850
Your son is an idiot.

160
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,890
That he's an idiot is unimportant,

161
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:34,610
what's important is that he's my son.

162
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,370
This is not good.

163
00:13:52,490 --> 00:13:54,290
Munna is like my son too.

164
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,170
He made a mistake, I smacked him.

165
00:13:59,690 --> 00:14:01,250
It's Holi after all, Akhanda.

166
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:04,890
Come, give me a hug.

167
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:14,370
Hey, start the music.

168
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,810
You want Mirzapur, don't you, Shukla?

169
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:27,170
Why ask me what you already know?

170
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:29,650
Because I can deliver it to you.

171
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:33,850
Contribute generously to the campaign,

172
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,930
after we win, I'll get the Chief
Minister to hand you Mirzapur.

173
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:41,610
Once upon a time, you were
humiliated and thrown out of Mirzapur.

174
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:43,050
Now, it's his turn.

175
00:14:45,450 --> 00:14:46,930
As for Munna...

176
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:49,010
You'll get the money.

177
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:50,570
But on one condition.

178
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,770
Akhandanand won't harm me or my family.

179
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:56,250
I won't leave him in a position to.

180
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:08,290
Did you try the sweets?

181
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:18,850
I've had a word with Shukla.

182
00:15:19,690 --> 00:15:21,890
He's agreed to a truce

183
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:25,490
only on my insistence.

184
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,970
Now we need your word too, Akhanda.

185
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,450
Well, at least he had the
sense to listen to you.

186
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,810
I have a condition.

187
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:36,050
My carpet trucks

188
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:39,130
should get free passage
through his territory.

189
00:15:39,770 --> 00:15:41,330
No interference.

190
00:15:50,210 --> 00:15:51,610
There you go. It's settled.

191
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:54,450
From this day, your enmity is over.

192
00:15:57,370 --> 00:15:58,570
Embrace each other!

193
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,250
Hmm?

194
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,050
Alright.

195
00:16:25,930 --> 00:16:28,050
I hope you're keeping an eye on Munna.

196
00:16:28,450 --> 00:16:30,330
He's in a drugged haze all day.

197
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:33,370
Is he trying to cut down at all?

198
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,610
You called, Papa?

199
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,930
Come here.

200
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:46,570
Sit.

201
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,890
Munna.

202
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:02,130
This power you wield...

203
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,810
you haven't had to do anything for it.

204
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:10,490
You just inherited it.

205
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:14,730
But power...

206
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,450
is like the hand that
holds the homespun gun,

207
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,250
you might lose it at any moment.

208
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,650
Yes, keep scolding him
like it's his fault.

209
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,970
First you let Mr Yadav get away
with slapping our boy in public,

210
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,090
and now you're bestowing
your pearls of wisdom.

211
00:17:28,210 --> 00:17:30,010
Go and relax, Munna bhaiya.

212
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:44,770
Listen!

213
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,250
I'm involving Guddu and
Bablu in the carpet business.

214
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:14,730
Munna bhaiya.

215
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,690
Shall I...?

216
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,370
Everyone is fucking me.

217
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,570
My turn now, fuckers.

218
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:35,530
I'm gonna take care of the curse

219
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,930
that is this surname... Tripathi!

220
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:41,930
I've been told since I was a child

221
00:18:42,050 --> 00:18:43,650
that everything is mine.

222
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:45,330
But I got nothing!

223
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:48,530
Nothing!

224
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:07,730
[Announcement on loudspeaker
for school admissions]

225
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:14,610
Look... I think...

226
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:19,570
you should at least
file your nomination.

227
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:25,090
I've never really thought
about getting into politics.

228
00:19:27,490 --> 00:19:29,210
Unless fresh blood enters politics...

229
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,330
how will things improve?

230
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:37,850
Let's assume you fill this form,

231
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,450
run for election,

232
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,130
and win.

233
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:43,300
At least Gajjumal College will end up

234
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,250
getting a better president
than Munna bhaiya.

235
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:46,450
Don't you think?

236
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:52,650
Everyone is fed up with Munna bhaiya.

237
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,490
But nobody in college dares to speak up.

238
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,490
You're working for him, aren't you?

239
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:03,610
I don't work for him.
I work for his father.

240
00:20:05,850 --> 00:20:06,850
Kaaleen bhaiya.

241
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,530
Anything else?

242
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:10,690
No, thank you.

243
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:16,570
You don't like tea?

244
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,210
No, no.

245
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:19,290
I like it.

246
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,450
Alright, then. I'll make you
tea with my own hands someday.

247
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,850
My father says I make excellent tea.

248
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:30,250
He refuses to let anyone
else make it when I'm around.

249
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,410
Sir, sweets?

250
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,490
Did you get them from
the local sweetshop?

251
00:20:52,090 --> 00:20:53,090
It's dark chocolate.

252
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:56,650
Oh, I've liked chocolate
since childhood! But...

253
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:58,890
this looks strange.

254
00:20:59,570 --> 00:21:00,570
It's opium.

255
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,610
It's called "dark
chocolate" in the business.

256
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:46,210
Fuckin' hell!

257
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,850
Hang on, so the other day when we...

258
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:00,850
transported the body in the truck...

259
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,010
we were delivering opium

260
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:05,530
in the carpets too?

261
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,930
I'd promised you

262
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,650
that if you improve the gun business,

263
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:24,210
I'd involve you in the bigger game.

264
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:27,930
Expand this too.

265
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,210
We'll come up with a plan.

266
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:35,570
Look here.

267
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:38,090
Oye, Hulk.

268
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:43,050
Listen carefully. I'll
only say this once.

269
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,370
Whatever you do,

270
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,450
check with me first.

271
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:52,130
- Hmm?
- Yes.

272
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:57,450
Sir, these foreign brands have
already hit the business hard,

273
00:22:57,730 --> 00:22:59,770
and people are suddenly
obsessed with juice.

274
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,730
The company's running at a loss.

275
00:23:04,410 --> 00:23:06,450
But I still sent you
the money last week.

276
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:12,530
The situation has changed, Chadha.

277
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:18,330
I need more money.

278
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,210
If you support me now,

279
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,890
I'll help grow your business.

280
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:24,770
How's that, sir?

281
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:28,650
I'll help you expand into Mirzapur.

282
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:31,490
Mirzapur is ruled by Kaaleen bhaiya.

283
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:37,970
Rulers can be overthrown, Chadha.

284
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,330
Greetings, Mr Yadav.

285
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,090
You remember your promise
about Mirzapur, don't you?

286
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:12,970
I'm putting together the money.

287
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:14,970
Send the money, Rati Shankar,

288
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:16,490
and trust me.

289
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:20,010
Mr Yadav, I'm doing
this because I trust you.

290
00:24:20,490 --> 00:24:21,650
Alright, then.

291
00:24:23,570 --> 00:24:24,730
Go to Shahpura.

292
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,330
Saxena is building two new hotels there.

293
00:24:28,410 --> 00:24:29,890
And you go to J C Avenue.

294
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:33,730
Laxmi Travels just started
running eight new buses there.

295
00:24:34,650 --> 00:24:37,210
Kiss or kick their asses;
get me the money they owe us.

296
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,090
Okay.

297
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:42,770
Yes, Sweety?

298
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:48,450
Alright, I'll be there.

299
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:51,530
Same place. Yeah.

300
00:24:56,490 --> 00:24:58,210
Sweety wants me to meet her father!

301
00:24:58,450 --> 00:25:00,290
Oh, bravo! Nicely done.

302
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:10,210
They're even bigger now.

303
00:25:10,330 --> 00:25:12,010
This is nothing, wait till you

304
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,810
see the rest of my body.

305
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,370
Every muscle stands
out, like in an X-ray.

306
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:19,570
I look forward to seeing
the rest of your body.

307
00:25:19,730 --> 00:25:21,106
Yeah, of course you'll get to see it...

308
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,610
in the Mr Purvanchal competition.

309
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:26,730
It's almost here, then
you can see all of me.

310
00:25:27,530 --> 00:25:29,530
I'm warning you.

311
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,330
Dad doesn't like me
hanging out with boys.

312
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:33,690
Please don't pressurize him anymore.

313
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,410
He literally stopped and prayed

314
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:37,930
at every temple on the way here.

315
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:39,906
He swore that if this
meeting with your father

316
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,770
goes well, he'll take
you on a holy pilgrimage.

317
00:25:47,970 --> 00:25:49,170
Papa's here.

318
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:54,130
Guddu sir, you?

319
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,690
- Bablu sir?
- Uncle.

320
00:25:55,770 --> 00:25:57,250
Oh! What are you doing, sir?

321
00:25:57,930 --> 00:25:59,370
- Yes, yes. You sit.
- Oh, you sit.

322
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:00,570
Okay, yes.

323
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:03,210
- You sit.
- Bablu, come here.

324
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,610
Sit, sit. Yes, you too.

325
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:12,850
Is this him?

326
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:16,210
Five cups of tea?

327
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,410
Yes, son.

328
00:26:17,930 --> 00:26:19,130
Samosas are on the way.

329
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:22,530
Sweety, you never told me that

330
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:24,010
Guddu sir is your friend.

331
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:26,490
Papa, at least don't call him sir.

332
00:26:29,610 --> 00:26:30,730
He's a good choice,

333
00:26:31,210 --> 00:26:32,210
I approve.

334
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:45,410
Oh, are you two also...?

335
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,490
- Papa, you...
- Wonderful, that's wonderful!

336
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,490
Both my girls marrying
into the same house!

337
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,650
What can be better than...

338
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:54,290
Papa, it isn't like
that. We're just friends.

339
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,290
- Just friends?
- Yes.

340
00:26:58,010 --> 00:26:59,010
Yes.

341
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,930
Come in, Mr Pandit. Please sit.

342
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,610
Hmm.

343
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:20,970
Here.

344
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,466
You've put together a solid case

345
00:27:22,490 --> 00:27:24,370
of public interest litigation.

346
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:26,610
But it's useless.

347
00:27:27,410 --> 00:27:29,290
Ask any child in Mirzapur, and he'll

348
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:31,290
tell you everything you need to know.

349
00:27:33,850 --> 00:27:34,850
But where's the evidence?

350
00:27:37,170 --> 00:27:38,170
Sir...

351
00:27:40,490 --> 00:27:42,290
if my sons wind up in jail,

352
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,090
they won't be able to murder anyone

353
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:47,810
nor will they get murdered.

354
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:51,610
I'm just trying to somehow...

355
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:54,210
stop them.

356
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,010
I understand.

357
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:01,330
My advice to you is to

358
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:03,410
act like a lawyer,

359
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,050
not a father.

360
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,690
Sugar, two kgs.

361
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,050
Rice...

362
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,650
I'd said two kgs of rice,

363
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,450
this feels like three kgs.

364
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:34,730
And all this...

365
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,106
and I'd only asked for
one kg of black gram.

366
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:38,250
That's two kgs too.

367
00:28:38,370 --> 00:28:40,490
Yes, the boss sent extra stuff.

368
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,210
Extra stuff? Why?

369
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:43,666
Is he not gonna charge for it?

370
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:45,530
Boss said he won't take money for this.

371
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:47,970
- It's all free.
- Why's it free?

372
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:50,866
Someone's giving you
free stuff on his own...

373
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,370
and you have a problem with that too?

374
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:55,010
You don't have to eat it.

375
00:28:55,250 --> 00:28:56,530
Plenty of people in the family.

376
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:58,250
If it's for free, no one will eat it.

377
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,530
Take the money and go.

378
00:28:59,610 --> 00:29:01,090
Sir, I... Er...

379
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:02,706
Are you taking it or should I make you?

380
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:04,370
Man, just take the money and go.

381
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:06,730
Go on, beat it.

382
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:09,490
Oh, the groceries are here.

383
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,706
Why'd you call me out
of my prayer meeting?

384
00:29:10,730 --> 00:29:12,370
It was going so well.

385
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,850
- Go on.
- What's this?

386
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:24,850
We've put down a
deposit on an apartment.

387
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:26,210
It's in Papa's and your name.

388
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:31,890
Lovely.

389
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:34,490
Should I just sit at home then, huh?

390
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,770
You'll provide for my
pension too, I'm sure.

391
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,330
Now you guys will do everything.

392
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:43,250
At least look at it first.

393
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:45,010
Mummy, I'll talk to Papa.

394
00:29:45,570 --> 00:29:46,570
Mummy, listen.

395
00:29:47,890 --> 00:29:49,690
Bhaiya wants you to meet somebody.

396
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,970
Who?

397
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:58,370
[movie dialogue offscreen]

398
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,930
[movie dialogue offscreen]

399
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,530
Here, have some.

400
00:30:08,930 --> 00:30:10,330
I like these a lot.

401
00:30:11,330 --> 00:30:12,330
Sir.

402
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,450
Take this.

403
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:22,450
I'm happy to meet you.

404
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,330
You know what Guddu does, right?

405
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:28,690
I do

406
00:30:29,050 --> 00:30:30,450
and I'm fine with it.

407
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:31,530
So am I!

408
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,290
The two of you will get along well.

409
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,330
It's not cold.

410
00:30:47,610 --> 00:30:49,010
But the bottle feels cold, sir.

411
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,290
Anything else, sir?

412
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:15,490
I thought you were going to...

413
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,490
I'm here with family,

414
00:31:18,570 --> 00:31:20,010
won't just start a fight randomly.

415
00:31:20,610 --> 00:31:22,490
Wasn't there a rom-com on?

416
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,130
I hate action movies.

417
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,890
I've decided to submit my nomination.

418
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,290
Will you come with me?

419
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,370
I'm a bit nervous,

420
00:31:34,650 --> 00:31:35,850
could use some moral support.

421
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,466
Yes, of course, Bablu
bhaiya has signed up

422
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,170
for a lifetime of moral
support, hasn't he?

423
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:42,570
First for Guddu bhaiya when
he wanted to meet Sweety.

424
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:46,130
And now for you when you
need to file your nomination.

425
00:31:46,610 --> 00:31:47,650
Go on.

426
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,050
Wasn't the food better than the movie?

427
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,490
- It was okay.
- Gave her the royal treatment and...

428
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:03,490
- she didn't enjoy it.
- But, it wasn't good!

429
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,490
You're all grown up now.

430
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:13,130
Bought an apartment for your old man.

431
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,130
So I guess you can find a
place for yourselves too.

432
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,930
We're on different sides now.

433
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:20,850
You can't be serious.

434
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:23,170
How can you just kick the boys out?

435
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,250
Do you want to join them?

436
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:26,450
Go on. No problem.

437
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:28,090
Or get inside.

438
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,250
My decision is final.

439
00:32:33,890 --> 00:32:34,890
Dimpy.

440
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:44,770
This isn't right.

441
00:32:45,010 --> 00:32:46,850
- They're our boys, how can you...
- Quiet!

442
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,370
This is ridiculous.

443
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,610
This is our home now.

444
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:54,930
[R S Maurya]

445
00:34:00,490 --> 00:34:02,600
- Yes, sir?
- Get me the files

446
00:34:02,604 --> 00:34:04,410
of everybody above the
rank of Sub-Inspector.

447
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:15,610
- Go to my house.
- Yes, sir.

448
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:18,570
Get my diabetes meds
and my dinner. Go on.

449
00:34:31,530 --> 00:34:32,530
Hmm.

450
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:36,410
Gajagamani Gupta.

451
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:39,810
Make sure your deeds are as mighty

452
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:42,450
as the weight your name carries.

453
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:47,650
Campaign vigorously, child.

454
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,770
Now that I've decided to contest

455
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:51,490
I will give it all I have.

456
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:53,450
Best of luck.

457
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,130
- Thank you, sir.
- Alright?

458
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:00,490
Have you planned ahead?

459
00:35:01,890 --> 00:35:04,570
Yes, putting together the next steps...

460
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:06,850
strategize for the campaign...

461
00:35:07,170 --> 00:35:08,410
focusing on that.

462
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:10,090
Hello, sir.

463
00:35:10,370 --> 00:35:11,850
Look at Munna bhaiya's poster!

464
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:13,290
I am Lallan Rai.

465
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,570
BA second year.

466
00:35:14,850 --> 00:35:16,370
Do put in a good word to Munna bhaiya.

467
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:18,010
I will.

468
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,610
Okay, now I'm worried...

469
00:35:23,410 --> 00:35:25,450
Are you on Munna bhaiya's side or mine?

470
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,050
What do you think?

471
00:35:29,610 --> 00:35:31,970
I'll stay in the background
but I'll canvass for you.

472
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:36,050
First, we need to figure
out your logo and poster.

473
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,090
- I already have.
- Oh?

474
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:42,210
Hmm.

475
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:43,290
Greetings, brother.

476
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,810
Yes, tell me.

477
00:35:44,970 --> 00:35:47,570
Yes, I've arranged for the cash.

478
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,050
You'll get it soon.

479
00:35:49,850 --> 00:35:52,850
- Hmm.
- You just focus on winning the election.

480
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,850
Leave the funding to me.

481
00:35:54,930 --> 00:35:58,490
The party rests on your shoulders, JP.

482
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:00,730
Well, I'm your younger
brother after all.

483
00:36:01,730 --> 00:36:04,050
and a humble servant of the party.

484
00:36:05,610 --> 00:36:06,610
Alright then.

485
00:36:06,930 --> 00:36:07,930
Hmm.

486
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,970
When will you become the Chief Minister?

487
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:14,090
Hmm?

488
00:36:15,290 --> 00:36:17,570
Or will I have to dance my life away?

489
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,050
Patience is bitter, but
its fruit is sweet, Zarina.

490
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:25,450
Will you stop dancing if I
become the Chief Minister?

491
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:26,850
No, but I'll dance

492
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,250
privately.

493
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,330
Only for you.

494
00:36:39,650 --> 00:36:40,650
You summoned me, sir?

495
00:36:41,010 --> 00:36:42,890
- Come in.
- Yes.

496
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:48,650
- Sir.
- Will you have some ice cream, Mr Gupta?

497
00:36:48,730 --> 00:36:49,730
No, sir. Thank you.

498
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:52,690
I asked because you look
like somebody who enjoys food.

499
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:55,370
Your belly has acquired
a life of its own.

500
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,130
Are you a policeman or a confectioner?

501
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,290
- Sit.
- Th... thank you, sir.

502
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:08,850
Show me your hand.

503
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:10,730
Here.

504
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:15,530
Looks like a pretty expensive watch, eh?

505
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:16,930
Tells the time correctly, does it?

506
00:37:20,610 --> 00:37:22,330
Okay, I'll come straight to the point.

507
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,490
How much do you make every month?

508
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:27,170
- Uh, sir?
- I don't mean your salary.

509
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,490
The toppings, so to speak.

510
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:29,690
I know your salary.

511
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:34,930
Look, sir...

512
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,970
I do my work with complete integrity.

513
00:37:40,210 --> 00:37:43,890
And in this job, I've only
earned one thing, respect.

514
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:48,330
That's all you've earned?

515
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,530
I know you're confused right now.

516
00:37:57,770 --> 00:37:58,890
New boss in town.

517
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,530
What's he thinking? Which side is he on?

518
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,930
Huh?

519
00:38:02,970 --> 00:38:05,170
No, sir. It hasn't crossed my mind.

520
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,650
Well... alright then.

521
00:38:09,970 --> 00:38:11,530
- Thank you, sir.
- One more thing...

522
00:38:13,210 --> 00:38:15,370
I'm a pretty open-minded guy.

523
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:20,010
If you feel like there's
something I ought to know,

524
00:38:20,850 --> 00:38:22,050
then let me know.

525
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,050
Yes, sir.

526
00:38:26,290 --> 00:38:27,290
Go on.

527
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:35,610
This Maurya is really
fucking with my head.

528
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,250
He just keeps eating
ice cream and smiling.

529
00:38:39,170 --> 00:38:40,170
I tried a lot.

530
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,130
But, I just can't figure him out.

531
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:44,250
Patience, Gupta.

532
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,570
We'll know eventually.

533
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,330
Yes, but... as per
protocol, he should've

534
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:50,570
come to meet you by now, right?

535
00:38:51,650 --> 00:38:53,650
Anyway, he's of a lower caste.

536
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:56,570
In society, between the
lower and upper castes...

537
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,570
Whether he's of lower
caste or upper, Mr Gupta

538
00:38:58,690 --> 00:38:59,746
don't forget that Mr Maurya is

539
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:01,050
a central government officer.

540
00:39:02,330 --> 00:39:04,490
He was sent to Mirzapur
as officer on special duty.

541
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,186
It's no laughing matter...

542
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:09,090
to clear the central examination,
and reach his position.

543
00:39:12,170 --> 00:39:13,450
Whatever his caste may be,

544
00:39:13,730 --> 00:39:15,570
if he's on our side, he's an ally

545
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:16,770
and if not, he's an enemy.

546
00:39:17,290 --> 00:39:18,650
It's simple.

547
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:23,650
Right, sir? You didn't hire
us because we're upper caste.

548
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,650
You must've seen something useful in us.

549
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:34,690
They always have a peculiar viewpoint.

550
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,890
I completely agree.

551
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:42,050
These two are quite smart.

552
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:52,730
Hey, listen.

553
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,746
Thought of a distribution plan
for the dark chocolate yet?

554
00:39:54,770 --> 00:39:55,770
Huh?

555
00:39:56,970 --> 00:39:59,050
Found a guy who can do it?

556
00:40:00,010 --> 00:40:01,010
Not a guy.

557
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,770
Huh? Not a guy...

558
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,650
What then? You'll make a woman do it?

559
00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:07,890
Not a woman either.

560
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:24,170
Greetings!

561
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,050
Sir, this is... opium.

562
00:40:35,170 --> 00:40:36,170
Sit.

563
00:40:43,330 --> 00:40:44,490
You don't have to use it.

564
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,170
Just sell it.

565
00:40:47,170 --> 00:40:49,170
Even the police doesn't frisk you guys.

566
00:40:51,010 --> 00:40:53,250
Didn't you say you have a solid network?

567
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:57,370
You have a finger on
all of Mirzapur's pulse.

568
00:40:58,010 --> 00:40:59,890
That makes you the
ideal candidate for us.

569
00:41:00,490 --> 00:41:01,490
Hmm?

570
00:41:01,970 --> 00:41:03,490
Do y'all think that

571
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:04,690
I'll just agree?

572
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,610
Because then,

573
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:10,050
be it rain or sunshine,

574
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,810
you'll never have to beg again.

575
00:41:15,690 --> 00:41:16,970
You'll earn money

576
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:19,570
and live with dignity.

577
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:28,650
Look, we're not forcing you.

578
00:41:29,730 --> 00:41:31,170
Only agree if you wish to.

579
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,410
Okay?

580
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,770
You see, we believe that in business,

581
00:41:34,890 --> 00:41:37,330
partnerships can't be forced.

582
00:41:40,530 --> 00:41:41,970
Did you just say "partner"?

583
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:45,770
No one's shown me that
kind of respect before.

584
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:50,450
I'll do it.

585
00:41:55,410 --> 00:41:56,850
There'll be profit-sharing.

586
00:41:57,570 --> 00:41:59,210
The more you sell, the more you earn.

587
00:41:59,330 --> 00:42:00,330
Alright?

588
00:42:01,410 --> 00:42:02,410
Well then, sir...

589
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,730
better get some more,

590
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,370
for the whole gang.

591
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,650
Babar.

592
00:42:18,970 --> 00:42:20,210
Make an entry for this batch.

593
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:23,770
Pande Motor Car Bazaar.

594
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:27,890
Sir, do you want to
buy a car or sell it?

595
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,010
What's this?

596
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,010
This car has been in many accidents.

597
00:43:38,930 --> 00:43:40,946
They used to run it in the
Well of Death at the carnival.

598
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,370
- Oh?
- We play with death too.

599
00:43:54,170 --> 00:43:55,210
Bablu...

600
00:43:56,250 --> 00:43:58,410
we've moving up in the world,
from two wheels to four.

601
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,970
Now, we'll mow down Mirzapur.

602
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:34,890
I've read all your
annual character reports.

603
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:36,050
Here, have some.

604
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,250
You all have bad ACRs.

605
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:44,210
So, you must be decent officers.

606
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,650
The problem is

607
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:50,370
this town is full of rogues.

608
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:52,170
So, we'll have to go rogue too.

609
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:54,090
What's the plan, sir?

610
00:44:56,170 --> 00:44:57,490
To eliminate, Sinha.

611
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:01,650
That's why I've put
together a special team.

612
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:05,130
I'm giving you a free hand.

613
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,370
Clean up Mirzapur.

614
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:08,930
Yes, sir.

615
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:14,930
Start with them.

616
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,000
