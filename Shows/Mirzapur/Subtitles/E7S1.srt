2
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:15,050
I'm nervous.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:16,810
What if nobody turns up?

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:19,650
Don't start worrying already,

5
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:23,130
just focus on your speech.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:31,690
What's all this?

7
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:35,850
Just making good on my promise

8
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,050
- that I'd canvass for you.
- Hello, sir.

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:39,410
Hello.

10
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:40,610
What do you think, sir?

11
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,010
It all looks great.

12
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:44,330
I think she likes it.

13
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:47,410
Well then

14
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,530
we've done our bit.

15
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,050
Your turn now.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:53,650
Vote for Golu Gupta.

17
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:55,210
Golu Gupta, remember that name.

18
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,290
There she is.

19
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:15,410
I am... Gajagamini Gupta...

20
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:17,570
... aka Golu,

21
00:01:19,010 --> 00:01:21,450
your presidential candidate.

22
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,770
I'm a bit nervous.

23
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,570
Uhmm...

24
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:32,090
you have no reason to trust me

25
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:35,810
but neither do you have
a reason to distrust me.

26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,770
I might not have any
political experience

27
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:43,130
but I know the difference
between right and wrong

28
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,650
which is why I guarantee you...

29
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:51,650
Yeah?

30
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,730
What?

31
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:56,130
We'll head there and shut it down.

32
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,570
Quite a speech going on there.

33
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:03,010
... a college is not just
labs, libraries, or classrooms.

34
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:05,010
Its identity is its students.

35
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:08,210
Shaped by you, by me, by all of us.

36
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:10,570
If you give me your vote,

37
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:12,370
it's not me who'll come into power,

38
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,930
it's you who will be empowered.

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:17,890
I will just represent you.

40
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:21,090
Finally, I just want to say

41
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,570
that if we win,

42
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:26,410
we'll work together and make
this college a better place!

43
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:28,730
And if I don't win...

44
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,970
well, I was happy
studying in the library

45
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:35,410
and I guess that won't change.

46
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:38,650
The decision is yours.

47
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,170
Vote for Golu Gupta!

48
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,410
Vote for Golu Gupta!

49
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:49,330
Vote for Golu Gupta!

50
00:02:49,450 --> 00:02:51,450
Vote for Golu Gupta!

51
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:53,170
Vote for Golu Gupta!

52
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,810
Oi, motherfucker!

53
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,410
Get the fuck out of here, assholes. ??

54
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,050
Golu, get down from there!

55
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,610
Bablu!

56
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,290
Golu, just listen to m...

57
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,610
Golu!

58
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,064
I decided to contest this election

59
00:04:09,065 --> 00:04:10,906
so I could help reduce
the violence in college.

60
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,130
And if I am the one...

61
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:15,970
If you want to use weapons,
you're done canvassing for me.

62
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,490
Is that understood?

63
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,570
Can I ask you something?

64
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,570
How long can you keep this up?

65
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,290
I didn't choose to start
this violence, Golu.

66
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,410
But you can choose to end it.

67
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:54,250
Violence is all very well until
it knocks on your own door.

68
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,490
What happens when you
have a family of your own?

69
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:03,810
Marriage isn't some necessity

70
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:10,050
and given my way of life,

71
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:13,250
it's best to never think about it.

72
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:26,650
You wrote a nice speech for me.

73
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:29,490
Thank you.

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,090
What's done is done,

75
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:41,730
you handled it well.

76
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:44,410
Greetings.

77
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,050
Hello, Guddu sir...

78
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,850
I mean, Guddu.

79
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,490
All okay?

80
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,050
All is well.

81
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:55,090
Usman?

82
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:57,730
The young bosses have
sorted out the system,

83
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,690
profits are through the roof.

84
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,290
Sirs, I'm officially a fan.

85
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:10,570
Right, the intel you wanted about
the informants near the Bihar border,

86
00:06:10,730 --> 00:06:11,730
I have it.

87
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,010
I've made contact...

88
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:21,550
Munna bhaiya!

89
00:06:21,570 --> 00:06:22,610
- Bhaiya!
- Hey!

90
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,450
Well, motherfucker?

91
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:29,850
You're canvassing against
me in the election?

92
00:06:30,050 --> 00:06:31,170
And you beat up my boys?

93
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,290
Munna bhaiya,

94
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,450
I'll explain everything,

95
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:36,570
have a seat, please.

96
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:49,330
Usman, tea for Munna bhaiya!

97
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,930
Look, it's no big deal.

98
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:57,430
These two landed up there,

99
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:58,706
pulled out their knives
and scared the students.

100
00:06:58,730 --> 00:06:59,730
Yeah, so?

101
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,490
Munna bhaiya, this canvassing...
it's my personal business.

102
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,650
How's it personal, huh?

103
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:10,770
Let it go, Compounder.
This is needless...

104
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:15,050
It's personal because

105
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:17,370
Golu Gupta's sister

106
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:18,890
is my girlfriend.

107
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:23,170
What did you say?

108
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:25,570
Golu's sister,

109
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:26,930
Sweety Gupta...

110
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:28,730
I'm her boyfriend.

111
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:30,530
Motherfucker!

112
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,850
Don't you dare utter Sweety's name.

113
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:36,810
Don't you dare.

114
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:39,850
Sweety is my love.

115
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,610
Sweety might be your love

116
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,650
but I am Sweety's love.

117
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:51,330
What did you say, motherfu...

118
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:54,010
Sir, for you

119
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:55,570
and you,

120
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,690
you too.

121
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:01,530
Why don't you lay out the whole
fucking buffet, cocksucker!

122
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:03,306
You were asked to bring
tea for me... one cup!

123
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:05,610
Does your mother warm
their beds at night,

124
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:07,450
to elicit such sycophancy?

125
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,610
What is it, huh?

126
00:08:40,330 --> 00:08:41,330
Let's go.

127
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,850
Bhaiyaji, this is their new car.

128
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,890
Shall we leave our mark?

129
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,210
No, man,

130
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:04,170
we're gonna hit them where it hurts now.

131
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,850
Okay, bye!

132
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:35,450
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye!

133
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:39,890
Come on. I wanna show
you something, I got this.

134
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,650
Oh, wow.

135
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:53,930
New dress?

136
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:55,730
Yeah.

137
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,050
You know my friend, Shabnam?

138
00:10:58,170 --> 00:11:00,730
- Yeah.
- I got this stitched especially for her wedding.

139
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,930
This is so beautiful!

140
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:14,850
What's the plan, Munna bhaiya?

141
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,930
What do you guys want?

142
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,170
What do you... ? Hey!

143
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:40,650
What the hell are you doing?

144
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,770
- Dimpy!
- Get in the car.

145
00:11:42,890 --> 00:11:44,410
Let me go!

146
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,370
Asshole, let her go!

147
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:47,450
Dimpy!

148
00:12:14,850 --> 00:12:15,850
Sweety?

149
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:19,090
What? Sweet... slow down.

150
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:21,450
When?! Where did they go?

151
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,090
Munna's taken Dimpy!

152
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,930
What?! Motherfucking cuntlicker!

153
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:28,290
- Where have they gone?
- They're heading out of town!

154
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:34,690
- Let me g...
- Shut up!

155
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:39,346
I'm going to kill Munna. I'm
going to kill the motherfucker.

156
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:40,370
Hello?

157
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,810
Hello, Maqbool.

158
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:46,250
Munna has just kidnapped
Dimpy from the college.

159
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:08,890
Motherfucker!

160
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,810
Snatched our sister!

161
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,050
She's just a kid, man!

162
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:15,930
Should I squeeze it?

163
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:18,610
I'm talking about the trigger.

164
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,370
Now should I squeeze it?

165
00:13:29,050 --> 00:13:30,170
Stop the car.

166
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,130
Or I swear I'll do it.

167
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:33,330
Do it,

168
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:34,650
put a hole in him.

169
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:38,930
Stop the car or I'll shoot.

170
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,810
Hey, hey, hey, Dimpy Pandit!

171
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:46,170
You don't wanna mess with
Munna Tripathi right now.

172
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:47,780
Not another sound

173
00:13:47,781 --> 00:13:51,090
or I'll rip out your tongue
and drape it around your neck!

174
00:13:51,210 --> 00:13:52,210
Sit down.

175
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,680
Dimpy!

176
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:08,306
- Motherfucker, I'll destr...
- Do it then.

177
00:14:08,330 --> 00:14:09,330
Stop!

178
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,530
Bablu!

179
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,170
Kaaleen bhaiya has summoned all of you.

180
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,210
Didn't I tell you that
women must be respected?

181
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,090
Have you lost your damn mind?

182
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:35,586
Why did you abduct their sister?

183
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:36,610
Yes, I have lost my mind!

184
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:38,306
And I took her because
she's their sister.

185
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:40,050
- I'll kill him!
- You.

186
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,050
Down.

187
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,210
Guddu bhaiya, lower the gun.

188
00:14:48,170 --> 00:14:49,170
Maqbool.

189
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:54,570
She got away this time

190
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:57,690
but I'll show her good next time.

191
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:58,890
What?

192
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:01,450
I'll drag her by the hair,

193
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,250
rip her clothes off,
and fuck her till she...

194
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,330
I'm not a fool, I didn't
abduct her on a whim.

195
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:29,130
They're canvassing
against me in the election!

196
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:37,890
Now please don't tell me that this
helps your business too somehow.

197
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,690
How is your preparation
for Mr Purvanchal going?

198
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:32,490
Fine, sir.

199
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,250
Stay focused on it.

200
00:16:47,730 --> 00:16:48,970
We'll take your leave, sir.

201
00:16:49,930 --> 00:16:50,930
Hmm.

202
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:07,450
What's wrong, Munna bhaiya?

203
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:11,650
You've been drinking
and snorting nonstop.

204
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,650
Please stop, that's enough.

205
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,530
You're right, Compounder,

206
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,210
enough is enough.

207
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:36,330
That's how he slapped me
in front of Guddu and Bablu.

208
00:17:43,250 --> 00:17:45,530
What, what are...

209
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,770
what are you doing?!

210
00:17:49,490 --> 00:17:51,330
I hope you know, Akhanda...

211
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,370
this time around,

212
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:57,210
it wasn't all Munna's fault.

213
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,250
I know, Bauji.

214
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:32,450
You're my best friend, aren't you?

215
00:18:32,730 --> 00:18:33,730
Of course.

216
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:12,170
Thank you, Sweety.

217
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,650
For trying to save Dimpy.

218
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:18,530
Don't be so formal.

219
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,970
After all, Dimpy and
Sweety are old friends.

220
00:19:28,050 --> 00:19:30,050
Let's go up to the terrace.

221
00:19:31,930 --> 00:19:35,330
Sis, you guys chill
here, we'll be around.

222
00:19:57,410 --> 00:19:59,890
You don't need to thank me.

223
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:02,090
Dimpy's your sister

224
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:04,690
so she's my family too.

225
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:12,370
Family? Do you mean... ?

226
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:25,810
Well, just thinking long-term.

227
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:31,250
You were right, Golu,

228
00:20:33,090 --> 00:20:35,370
violence came knocking
on my own door today.

229
00:20:40,090 --> 00:20:43,090
I was terrified when Munna took Dimpy.

230
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:52,130
You know something?

231
00:20:54,770 --> 00:20:57,610
Our talk today, your take on violence...

232
00:21:00,850 --> 00:21:01,890
I appreciate that.

233
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,010
It made me respect you even more.

234
00:21:25,210 --> 00:21:26,650
If you want to kiss me,

235
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:28,610
I won't stop you.

236
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,050
Go on.

237
00:22:19,450 --> 00:22:23,170
Slow down, Guddu, there's no rush.

238
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,970
- Guddu!
- Hold on.

239
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:36,810
Th... the birds are
especially melodic today, eh?

240
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,930
And the stars... the stars are
shining real bright tonight!

241
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:43,850
The stars shine just
like this every night.

242
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:47,210
Yeah, but...

243
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:50,570
just noticing them today, I guess.

244
00:22:50,610 --> 00:22:51,690
You've never done it?

245
00:22:53,290 --> 00:22:54,290
Sex.

246
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:02,490
You?

247
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:05,610
What if I say I have?

248
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,810
Does that make me bad?

249
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:10,730
No.

250
00:23:10,930 --> 00:23:11,930
Not at all.

251
00:23:12,690 --> 00:23:14,290
Maybe you could give me some tips,

252
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,770
I sure could use them.

253
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,130
Sure, you wrote my speech,
I'll write you sex tips.

254
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:23,850
Yeah, perfect!

255
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:28,410
Want some tea?

256
00:23:30,770 --> 00:23:32,290
Come on, it won't be that bad.

257
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,890
I'm sure I could drink
it the rest of my life.

258
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,210
Bablu,

259
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,370
how was the tea?

260
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:02,810
Hey, listen,

261
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:05,890
how do you feel about Sweety?

262
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,410
I mean, as your sister-in-law, fuckhead.

263
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:13,090
Well, it's your decision,

264
00:24:14,850 --> 00:24:16,650
I like her.

265
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:27,690
I think we should send
Dimpy away to Lucknow,

266
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:30,226
Mirzapur isn't safe anymore.

267
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:31,690
Motherfucker!

268
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,770
What the...

269
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:36,090
Watch out!

270
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,330
That way! After them!

271
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:41,730
Motherf...

272
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,330
- Motherf...
- Look ahead!

273
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,290
Fucking sons of bitches.

274
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:28,610
Guddu bhaiya, forget the car.

275
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,730
We need to move.

[Local news plays on the television]

278

Secure all entry and exit points!

279
00:25:41,210 --> 00:25:43,130
Don't let the fuckers get away!

280
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:46,770
You guys head upstairs, I'll look here.

281
00:25:46,930 --> 00:25:48,170
Move it!

282
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:52,450
Open the door! Everybody out!

283
00:25:55,370 --> 00:25:56,410
Hey, show me your face.

284
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:57,930
Show your face!

285
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:00,130
Get out now.

286
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,650
Take the kid inside.

287
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:04,210
Don't let the bastards slip away.

288
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:06,050
Find them, dead or alive.

289
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,650
Don't you move, motherfucker.

290
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:22,330
Motherfucking sons of bitches.

291
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,090
He's on the first
floor balcony, get him.

292
00:26:29,850 --> 00:26:32,570
Farookh! Farookh, are you okay?

293
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:35,770
Wait, cocksucker!

294
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,770
Shoot to kill the fuckers!

295
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,690
- Mummy!
- Move ahead.

296
00:26:40,690 --> 00:26:41,850
Move it.

297
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,610
Son of a bitch.

298
00:26:49,490 --> 00:26:50,490
Motherfucker!

299
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:52,450
Hey!

300
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:55,370
Tell me where your brother is
or I'll shoot you right here.

301
00:26:55,930 --> 00:26:57,170
Tell me now!

302
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:02,250
Guddu!

303
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:05,370
Guddu, come on.

304
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,850
There they are, on the third floor!

305
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,850
- Guddu!
- The cocksuckers are on the top floor!

306
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:36,970
Come on.

307
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:38,650
Look in every room!

308
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,530
Bastards.

309
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:43,170
Don't let them escape!

310
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,210
Check there!

311
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,210
Guddu!

312
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:07,330
Come on.

313
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:10,050
They blew up our new car, man.

314
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:19,090
I pointed a gun at Munna the other day,

315
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,106
you think Kaaleen
bhaiya sent these guys?

316
00:28:21,130 --> 00:28:22,210
That's out of the question.

317
00:28:22,490 --> 00:28:25,130
Kaaleen bhaiya could shoot us in
broad daylight, if he felt like.

318
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,690
Wait, I'm gonna call him.

319
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:38,490
Yes?

320
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:40,010
Sir,

321
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:42,090
we were ambushed right now.

322
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:47,810
And those guys were definitely
not from around here,

323
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,690
they were clearly well-trained.

324
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,530
Could it be Rati Shankar Shukla?

325
00:28:51,690 --> 00:28:52,850
No, not him,

326
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,610
we agreed to a truce.

327
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:58,530
Listen, lay low for a few days,

328
00:28:58,770 --> 00:28:59,770
get out of Mirzapur.

329
00:28:59,970 --> 00:29:01,730
Why should we leave Mirzapur?

330
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:04,490
It's our town,
we'll track those guys and kill them.

331
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,850
You'll track nobody.

332
00:29:07,010 --> 00:29:08,890
- Bablu.
- Yes, sir?

333
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:10,810
Explain to your brother,

334
00:29:11,330 --> 00:29:13,450
not to use his mind
if he doesn't have one.

335
00:29:13,650 --> 00:29:15,250
Do as I say.

336
00:29:15,370 --> 00:29:16,450
Yes, sir.

337
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:22,050
Sir, the Bihar border informants...
we have their intel from Gupta.

338
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,330
We could head there and...

339
00:29:25,410 --> 00:29:27,130
Fuck this shit.

340
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,130
I'll speak to you soon.

341
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:37,650
I think it's Maurya. He's lost his mind.

342
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:42,610
Keep an eye on Munna.

343
00:29:44,490 --> 00:29:45,490
Will do.

344
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,290
Who the fuck are you calling now?

345
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:26,330
Hang up.

346
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:29,370
I'm running out of pills and
the contest is almost here.

347
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,250
Compounder isn't picking up.

348
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:35,090
Pick up, man. Motherfucking shit!

349
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,130
What the...

350
00:31:43,130 --> 00:31:46,690
I'll fuck Compounder up if he
doesn't give me those pills.

351
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,450
Calm down, we'll head there first.

352
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:01,250
Where are you, man?

353
00:32:08,450 --> 00:32:09,970
Who leaves their bloody phone at home?

354
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,810
What the fuck?

355
00:32:59,130 --> 00:33:00,730
Now we can go, bro.

356
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,330
Bablu, where are we headed?

357
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:07,690
There's an informant waiting
for us at the Bihar border.

358
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:22,930
What happened, Maqbool?

359
00:33:24,490 --> 00:33:25,490
Papa?

360
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,290
Alive.

361
00:33:53,410 --> 00:33:57,050
Your friend Compounder tried to kill me.

362
00:33:59,690 --> 00:34:00,690
Compou...

363
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,250
has he said anything?

364
00:34:08,050 --> 00:34:10,090
Ask him yourself.

365
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,530
Why did you do this?

366
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:45,170
Speak up, Compounder,

367
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:54,130
you'll have to 'fess up.

368
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:22,850
I...

369
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:27,530
I'd heard that...

370
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:34,050
the business was doing really well,

371
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,410
that there was a lot
of cash in the house.

372
00:35:42,090 --> 00:35:43,410
I came for that.

373
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:53,650
Suddenly, Kaaleen bhaiya appeared

374
00:35:58,250 --> 00:36:00,330
and I instinctively attacked him.

375
00:36:03,290 --> 00:36:07,610
I'd heard that he's loyal to you.

376
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,690
He's been loyal, yes,

377
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,410
no doubt about that.

378
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:34,170
I made a mistake, Munna bhaiya.

379
00:36:37,090 --> 00:36:38,090
Do it.

380
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:42,530
Do it.

381
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,850
You don't have a choice.

382
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,130
Kill me.

383
00:37:11,610 --> 00:37:12,610
Lower.

384
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,250
Lower.

385
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:32,530
One clean stroke.

386
00:38:15,410 --> 00:38:19,130
Maqbool, make sure word
of this doesn't get out,

387
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:20,850
people might get the wrong message.

388
00:40:27,690 --> 00:40:29,410
Three officers are
still in the hospital,

389
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:31,690
no casualties.

390
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,835
Put it down in the
records that the officers

391
00:40:33,836 --> 00:40:35,810
got injured during routine training.

392
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:37,370
Right, sir.

393
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:20,170
Listen.

394
00:41:20,610 --> 00:41:23,850
Survey all the entry and
exit points to this place

395
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,650
and have some boys stand guard.

396
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,370
- Yes, sir.
- Alright.

397
00:41:27,770 --> 00:41:29,210
This way, sir.

398
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:42,570
How do you like the room, sir?

399
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:46,690
This is the best room in the
best hotel in all of Ghazipur,

400
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,770
I booked it myself!

401
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:52,850
If this is the best room in
the best hotel in all of town,

402
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,530
then Ghazipur must be
a pretty shitty place.

403
00:41:56,610 --> 00:41:57,850
Come on, sir,

404
00:41:58,210 --> 00:42:00,010
you were the one who
said "keep it discreet",

405
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:01,610
that's why I selected this place!

406
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:02,970
Yes, yes, the room's great.

407
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,090
The thing is...

408
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:10,450
Mr Gupta called a few days ago.

409
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:14,170
He said that you were coming
here to make some deals.

410
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:16,890
There's an interested party from Bihar.

411
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:18,610
If you wish,

412
00:42:18,890 --> 00:42:19,890
I can talk to them.

413
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,090
Do you understand what
'laying low' means?

414
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:25,490
We came to Ghazipur
because we are in hiding.

415
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:27,850
Let's meet them.

416
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:33,850
We're here, might as
well make some money.

417
00:42:35,650 --> 00:42:36,890
We've got the sample guns.

418
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,050
How long can we stay in this shit hole?

419
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:42,850
Get to work.

420
00:42:43,490 --> 00:42:45,130
Okay, sir.

421
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:09,410
Come, come, gentlemen.

422
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,490
Beautiful!

423
00:43:15,090 --> 00:43:16,850
Bravo!

424
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:20,450
I think I just creamed my pants.

425
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:22,706
We'll need an advance for the guns.

426
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:26,570
- Your move, man.
- Son, get the money out.

427
00:43:27,450 --> 00:43:29,770
You guys should look into the
prohibition in Bihar as well,

428
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:31,570
get some booze flowing.

429
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:33,530
Sir.

430
00:43:33,730 --> 00:43:35,250
I have another client.

431
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,250
If we impress him,

432
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:39,530
he'll want a shitload of guns.

433
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,290
Give me the details,

434
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:43,250
- I'll see to it.
- Alright, sir.

435
00:43:43,290 --> 00:43:44,290
Here.

436
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,170
Thank you, sir.

437
00:43:57,970 --> 00:43:59,010
Shall we go, Guddu bhaiya?

438
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:11,570
This is a bad idea.

439
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,530
Look at our profits and
stop cribbing, will you?

440
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:17,610
Bablu.

441
00:45:28,610 --> 00:45:29,610
Bablu!

442
00:45:35,330 --> 00:45:36,330
Bablu!

443
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:44,330
I've been thinking.

444
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:47,890
Hmm.

445
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,810
Are you certain it
wasn't Kaaleen bhaiya?

446
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,450
Hmm?

447
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:00,290
Yes, I'm certain it
wasn't Kaaleen bhaiya.

448
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:03,840
He didn't order the
attack and he's told us

449
00:46:03,841 --> 00:46:05,266
to lay low so let's just do that. Okay?

450
00:46:05,290 --> 00:46:06,770
Why are you so fucking scared of him?

451
00:46:06,890 --> 00:46:07,890
Huh?

452
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:11,370
We're in hiding

453
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:13,370
and we're still bringing in profits.

454
00:46:23,090 --> 00:46:24,690
Listen, we're hitting the road tomorrow,

455
00:46:26,770 --> 00:46:28,290
there's another buyer.

456
00:46:28,690 --> 00:46:31,330
Alright, we'll deal with that shit
in the morning, just sleep now.

457
00:46:31,450 --> 00:46:33,890
What else is there to
do in this fucking room?!

458
00:46:34,970 --> 00:46:36,050
Even the TV...

459
00:46:36,130 --> 00:46:37,626
even the motherfucking TV doesn't work.

460
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:38,690
Have you lost it?

461
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:10,250
Wait, Jaunpur? That's
Rati Shankar's territory.

462
00:47:10,330 --> 00:47:12,210
Our new client is there,
don't worry about it.

463
00:47:12,850 --> 00:47:14,370
Think of it as a market survey.

464
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:15,650
Stop the car.

465
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:18,410
- Come on, man.
- I'm telling you. Stop the car!

466
00:47:18,650 --> 00:47:19,650
There.

467
00:47:20,170 --> 00:47:21,746
Do you get a kick out
of doing shit like this?

468
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,050
You're not using your
head, Guddu bhaiya!

469
00:47:24,170 --> 00:47:25,826
Well, apparently you're the
only one who's allowed to use it.

470
00:47:25,850 --> 00:47:27,066
I don't want to argue with you.

471
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:29,250
All I'm saying is that if
you're going to Jaunpur...

472
00:47:29,330 --> 00:47:30,410
I'm not coming along.

473
00:47:30,570 --> 00:47:32,130
Fine, don't come, I'll go alone.

474
00:47:32,410 --> 00:47:33,410
Alright.

475
00:47:41,690 --> 00:47:42,690
Go!

476
00:47:44,570 --> 00:47:46,610
Do you have a fucking
problem with this too?

477
00:47:46,890 --> 00:47:48,250
No, sir.

478
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:21,610
This is good,

479
00:48:22,290 --> 00:48:23,290
get one more.

480
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:24,970
One more.

481
00:48:25,850 --> 00:48:26,850
Two more.

482
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:35,010
Might as well get two samosas too.

483
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:37,730
Samosas too, please.

484
00:49:07,970 --> 00:49:09,170
Relax, lads.

485
00:49:11,130 --> 00:49:12,570
I'm the client.

486
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,610
But, I don't want your guns.

487
00:49:29,930 --> 00:49:31,566
Nobody in Mirzapur would dare

488
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:35,210
to fire a shot without
Akhanda's permission.

489
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:41,490
And you guys were attacked...
fired at indiscriminately.

490
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,450
Who do you think ordered the hit?

491
00:49:47,730 --> 00:49:49,010
Think about it long and hard.

492
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,050
- Look, Rati bhaiya...
- Let's hear him out, Bablu.

493
00:49:57,290 --> 00:49:58,650
You're the younger one, right?

494
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:00,530
Keep quiet.

495
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:02,930
I'm talking to your big brother.

496
00:50:03,890 --> 00:50:04,890
Sit.

497
00:50:06,130 --> 00:50:07,130
Sit down.

498
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:16,490
Well?

499
00:50:18,170 --> 00:50:20,210
I hear Munna had
abducted your sister too.

500
00:50:20,890 --> 00:50:21,890
Hmm?

501
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,330
Every Tripathi generation

502
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:26,530
is a bigger asshole than the last.

503
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,370
You seem to have gathered
a lot of intel on us.

504
00:50:30,050 --> 00:50:32,330
Because you and I, we're the same.

505
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:36,370
I used to work for the Tripathis,

506
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,770
you work for them too.

507
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:39,850
I was loyal,

508
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:41,370
so are you.

509
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:43,290
I got fucked over,

510
00:50:44,770 --> 00:50:46,130
you'll get fucked over too.

511
00:50:50,530 --> 00:50:52,010
Join me.

512
00:50:56,770 --> 00:50:58,970
Together, we'll rule Mirzapur.
