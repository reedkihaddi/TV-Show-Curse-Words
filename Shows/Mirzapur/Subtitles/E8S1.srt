2
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,410
The uniform suits you.

3
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:49,090
Tripathi, Akhandanand.

4
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,730
Ram Sharan Maurya.

5
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:00,450
Where's Munna?

6
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:03,370
Right to work, I see.

7
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:08,810
You're here for the first time

8
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,570
as my honored guest.
Have something first.

9
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:12,650
Yes, this is my first time here.

10
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,410
But a guest, I am not, Mr Tripathi.

11
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:20,610
Maqbool.

12
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:33,970
Citizens have no respect
for authority anymore,

13
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,410
for people like you and I.

14
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:43,810
I worry about Mirzapur.

15
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:50,890
Well Mr Tripathi, it's not like
you're some... "king" of Mirzapur

16
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:53,050
to worry about its people.

17
00:01:53,570 --> 00:01:55,930
So, you just worry about your safety,

18
00:01:57,610 --> 00:01:59,130
the police will handle the town.

19
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:01,010
And I'm here, of course.

20
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:06,610
Well?

21
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:09,010
I hear Munna had
abducted your sister too.

22
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,290
Every Tripathi generation is
a bigger asshole than the last.

23
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,930
Join me.

24
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:23,530
Together, we'll rule Mirzapur.

25
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,530
You're one hell of a cunt.

26
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:46,250
It's an internal issue,
we'll sort it out ourselves.

27
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:49,250
If a snake extends a hand of friendship,

28
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:52,170
you know he's bullshitting,
because he has no hands.

29
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,330
A snake, am I?

30
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,570
I was giving you a choice, motherfucker.

31
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,330
Easy there.

32
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,810
Sir, shall we make them
recite the alphabet?

33
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:08,290
Yes, we will.

34
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:11,330
This is my territory, assholes,

35
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,330
don't you tell me how to run my affairs.

36
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:20,170
I'll fuck your moth...

37
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:33,450
Yes, Yadav?

38
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:35,210
I'm getting fucked
in the arse, Tripathi.

39
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,506
Why don't you have a go too?

40
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:38,290
A truce was brokered in the conclave.

41
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,170
Was I crazy to patch things
up between the two of you?

42
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,730
And now your boys
have gone and shot him!

43
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:49,490
You want the alphabet, motherfucker?

44
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:51,970
A, B, C, D, E...

45
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,570
F, G, H, I, J...

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,130
K, L, M, N, O...

47
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:59,530
P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X...

48
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:03,650
Y, Z.

49
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:14,370
You can either choose to be with us

50
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:15,810
or lie with him.

51
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:19,370
Not much of a choice
is it, motherfuckers?

52
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,010
Put your guns down if you want to live.

53
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,250
Motherfu...

54
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:31,610
Do you have no control over your men?

55
00:04:32,050 --> 00:04:33,170
Did you even give the order?

56
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,690
I did.

57
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,690
He was needling my boys,

58
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:44,890
I just needled him back.

59
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,250
He was in over his head,

60
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:51,730
don't let it bother you.

61
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,370
I'm not bothered by his death!

62
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:57,450
But if you ordered the
hit, you broke the code.

63
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,466
Purvanchal will spiral out
of control without the code.

64
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:00,490
Mr Yadav.

65
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:04,170
Purvanchal is in my control.

66
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:06,010
And will so remain.

67
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:10,650
I'd like to see someone
challenge my authority.

68
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,930
Focus on the election,

69
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:20,090
leave all this to me.

70
00:05:24,210 --> 00:05:25,690
Motherfucker.

71
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,370
I'll be off, Tripathi.

72
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:36,450
Kaaleen bhaiya.

73
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,890
That's what my men call me.

74
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:43,090
Oh.

75
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:45,090
And my men call me "Sir",

76
00:05:45,290 --> 00:05:46,290
Tripathi.

77
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:48,170
See you.

78
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:01,930
Sir, water?

79
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:04,210
I won't be having any
water till the competition.

80
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,450
Why're you so quiet, huh?

81
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,170
You know damn well why.

82
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:09,410
I don't!

83
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,130
If I open my mouth, it'll
only be to swear at you.

84
00:07:15,370 --> 00:07:17,810
Rati Shankar was Kaaleen
bhaiya's enemy, wasn't he?

85
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:19,210
So what if I offed him?

86
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:22,610
Set fire to all of
Mirzapur for all I care

87
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:24,610
so long as it's on Kaaleen
bhaiya's instruction.

88
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,250
How many times has Kaaleen bhaiya said

89
00:07:26,251 --> 00:07:28,050
not to do anything
without his permission?

90
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,170
Huh?

91
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,890
How many fucking times?

92
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:34,530
And for just how long
will I be wiping your arse?

93
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:36,626
Why are you shitting yourself
over a little shooting?

94
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,010
It's not the shooting,

95
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,851
it's the fun you're having
killing people that worries me!

96
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:49,850
There, here comes the call.

97
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,850
Hello, Kaaleen bhaiya.

98
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,530
Here's the loot.

99
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:30,890
Everybody leave!

100
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,730
Sir, I'll...

101
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:37,690
- Keep it.
- Yes, sir.

102
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:45,050
Maqbool, ask them to sit.

103
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:24,610
Sir, whatever happened in Jaunpur...

104
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:26,130
You fucking idiots!

105
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,450
My men don't touch a
hair on someone's head

106
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,050
without my permission.

107
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:43,610
Honestly, the situation got out of hand.

108
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:47,850
- And anyway, Rati Shankar...
- Let me talk, don't interrupt!

109
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:00,690
Look, sir.

110
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,130
Rati Shankar was your
nemesis after all, wasn't he?

111
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,730
All of Mirzapur knows
your history with him,

112
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,250
we heard the stories too growing up.

113
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:16,250
Taking him out only helps you.

114
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:26,610
The point isn't whether
Rati Shankar was our nemesis,

115
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:33,730
the point is that you took a
decision without our permission.

116
00:10:40,810 --> 00:10:42,970
- We're sorry, Bauji.
- Sorry for what, man?

117
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,690
There you go brown-nosing again!

118
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:51,210
Sir, we're in your service
but not your servants.

119
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:53,010
Hmm?

120
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:55,730
He had AK-47s aimed at us,

121
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,490
gave us an offer to join his gang,

122
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:00,730
insulted us to our faces!

123
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:04,970
Should I have called and asked
for your permission at that moment?

124
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:06,050
I just shot him.

125
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,215
If we come running to you
for every little thing,

126
00:11:12,216 --> 00:11:14,130
how will any work get done?

127
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:19,050
And what about all the
profits we've made you?

128
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:20,770
Hmm?

129
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,690
Is it really necessary to
consult you before every decision?

130
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:31,890
Look, sir,

131
00:11:32,970 --> 00:11:34,330
it felt right in the moment,

132
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:35,890
so I did it.

133
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:47,050
Okay.

134
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,490
It's a free country.

135
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:52,810
I guess every man can do as he wishes.

136
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,210
Even I.

137
00:11:58,650 --> 00:11:59,650
See!

138
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:01,770
Kaaleen bhaiya agrees with me.

139
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,210
We have the authority, get
that through your skull.

140
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,770
Can we leave, sir?

141
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,690
Go on.

142
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:38,010
Your worms are turning
into snakes, Akhanda,

143
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,530
tread carefully.

144
00:12:42,210 --> 00:12:44,290
It needed clarifying,
and they understood,

145
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,090
we're invaluable to them, Bablu.

146
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,730
No reason for it to escalate to Bauji,

147
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,210
we're not like Munna, man!

148
00:12:50,450 --> 00:12:53,810
All this nonsense about
protocol, permissions...

149
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,010
Drop me home.

150
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,050
You're going back to the factory?

151
00:13:03,410 --> 00:13:04,450
I said, home!

152
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,530
Or have you forgotten
where we come from?

153
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:15,050
I won't go in.

154
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:21,650
When do I come get you?

155
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:38,130
Sweety! How are you?

156
00:13:38,810 --> 00:13:40,210
You just vanished

157
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,570
after what happened that day.

158
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,330
Wham, bam, thank you ma'am.

159
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:49,570
Guess we're done then.

160
00:13:51,570 --> 00:13:52,570
Where are you?

161
00:14:03,890 --> 00:14:05,450
Let's try our luck around station road.

162
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:06,770
We'll find some customers there.

163
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,050
If there is any stuff left...

164
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:14,410
What, sir? You wanna see? Shall I?

165
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:17,650
You ain't showing us
nothing, get in the van!

166
00:14:20,490 --> 00:14:23,050
Do we have to pay off
senior officers directly now?

167
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:25,770
Why did you pick us up, sir?

168
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,890
It's strange, of late I've
seen you guys around a lot,

169
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,530
but not once have I seen you begging.

170
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,410
Why did you give money to Babur Khan?

171
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:45,570
Oh, that...

172
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:48,490
that was nothing, you know our madam,

173
00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:50,810
- Sridevi...
- Sridevi?

174
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:52,210
- Yes.
- I see, go on.

175
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:53,850
She was very ill, sir.

176
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,970
We needed money for her
operation and we didn't have any.

177
00:14:58,210 --> 00:15:00,210
So we borrowed it from Babur bhaiya.

178
00:15:00,330 --> 00:15:02,570
Jasmine, they must've seen
us returning the money.

179
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:05,970
Okay, alright,

180
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,770
so how is she now?

181
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,090
Uh, who?

182
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:11,210
Sridevi.

183
00:15:12,530 --> 00:15:15,970
She's much better, still weak though.

184
00:15:16,130 --> 00:15:18,650
You know, we try to give
her whatever little we ca...

185
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:21,010
That's very generous of you.

186
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:24,210
Take care of her, understood?

187
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:27,250
Otherwise I'll beat the
shit out of the both of you,

188
00:15:27,370 --> 00:15:29,490
and dump your bodies where
no one will ever find them.

189
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:35,371
You guys love exposing your
privates in public, don't you?

190
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,210
Go on, show me.

191
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:45,130
Pick it up!

192
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,490
Enough, down.

193
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,210
Up.

194
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:54,370
Pick it up.

195
00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,090
Here, feast your eyes, sir!

196
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,370
Yeah, yeah, enough.

197
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,410
Go on, get out of here.

198
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:02,810
Come, Jasmine.

199
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,530
Wait a minute.

200
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,890
There's nothing in the saree,

201
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:13,610
but what about the blouse, huh?

202
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:16,970
- What's in there?
- It was an accident, sir!

203
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:18,050
Make them shit.

204
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:52,970
It should be done by the next hearing.

205
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,130
Thank you, Mr Pandit.

206
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,290
You're the only one who
cares about people like m...

207
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:58,010
I'm always here

208
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:01,010
as long as you need me.

209
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:13,450
Mr Sharma, we'll talk,

210
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,170
you should go now, goodbye.

211
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:40,410
Will you have some tea, Papa?

212
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,570
I'll make it just the way you like it.

213
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:53,370
I really need to talk to you.

214
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:49,850
Papa, my... job it's just like
being employed anywhere else.

215
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,690
Work hard, use your mind,

216
00:18:54,730 --> 00:18:56,050
keep the boss happy,

217
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,490
get a paycheck,

218
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,210
come home and get a good night's sleep.

219
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:09,730
I treated it like any other posting.

220
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:16,650
But, now...

221
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,290
I'm scared, Papa.

222
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:29,810
What happened, Bablu?

223
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,570
Do you think I had a
choice? To stay out of it?

224
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,530
The path I'm on...

225
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:54,530
I can't help but wonder
what lies at its end.

226
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,130
There's no doubt, Bablu

227
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,970
that it will end in hell.

228
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:19,490
I don't know what's harder,

229
00:20:21,410 --> 00:20:30,010
joining the mob in the
first place or leaving it.

230
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,530
Once you make up your mind,

231
00:20:38,610 --> 00:20:40,290
nothing's difficult, son.

232
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,930
Sweety, I have just one thing to say.

233
00:20:56,370 --> 00:20:57,890
I love you.

234
00:20:59,410 --> 00:21:02,490
I've even discussed
our marriage with Bablu.

235
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,890
I'm not exactly dying to marry you.

236
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:10,330
Okay, but I am.

237
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:13,130
Yeah? How much?

238
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:16,610
So much that I could marry you tomorrow.

239
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,010
If I say yes, you're trapped.

240
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:26,770
Consider me caught,
hook, line and sinker.

241
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,250
We're getting married tomorrow!

242
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,770
Yes!

243
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,730
- Guddu!
- It's gonna be perfect!

244
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:42,650
It'll be a small affair.

245
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:46,050
As for my family, I don't
even know if Papa will come.

246
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:47,970
Just one thing...

247
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:51,170
I'll want a dowry.

248
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:53,090
Now you want a dowry too?!

249
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,650
Guddu, are you fucking with me?

250
00:21:57,770 --> 00:21:58,850
Oh, man...

251
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:01,410
just bring me a pocketful of luck

252
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,850
so that I smash everyone
at the competition.

253
00:22:19,010 --> 00:22:20,330
Sign here,

254
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,650
you here.

255
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:45,730
You are now husband and wife.

256
00:24:58,770 --> 00:24:59,930
Munna bhaiya?

257
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,210
Get up and shave, come on,

258
00:25:07,650 --> 00:25:09,490
you've been moping in bed for days.

259
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,410
I don't want to.

260
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:19,850
You don't have to,

261
00:25:21,850 --> 00:25:22,930
I'll shave you.

262
00:25:30,250 --> 00:25:33,170
I'm sorry I couldn't
come to the wedding.

263
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:36,610
Guddu's Papa wouldn't,
so I couldn't either.

264
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,370
But, you're very welcome here.

265
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,450
This house is yours too now.

266
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:43,170
Come in.

267
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,050
No, it's fine.

268
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:46,330
Come here, I'll bless you too.

269
00:25:46,490 --> 00:25:47,490
This is closer.

270
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,570
Welcome, Sweety!

271
00:26:02,810 --> 00:26:03,930
Come with me.

272
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,890
You go on, he won't stop you.

273
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:09,530
Don't ask me to, we have issues.

274
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:10,650
Go on.

275
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:19,370
Bless you.

276
00:26:20,570 --> 00:26:22,170
You're the first bride in this family.

277
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,330
I should've come to the wedding.

278
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:29,890
But, he's endangering
your life by marrying you.

279
00:26:33,450 --> 00:26:34,850
Anyway, you're welcome here.

280
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:40,090
- Vasudha!
- Yes?

281
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,210
Begin the rituals for the bride.

282
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:44,370
Come.

283
00:26:54,850 --> 00:26:55,850
You too!

284
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:57,890
Come in.

285
00:27:04,530 --> 00:27:06,010
Now that you're married

286
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:09,570
have you given your future a thought?

287
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:16,770
Look, Papa, this path
is a one-way street,

288
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:19,010
no reverse gear, no U-turn.

289
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:21,410
So don't waste your time

290
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:24,410
because I'm not either.

291
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:26,090
Just stop worrying.

292
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,010
You'll only understand

293
00:27:30,210 --> 00:27:31,330
when you become a father.

294
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:38,090
Dimpy!

295
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,250
Where's Bablu?

296
00:27:39,370 --> 00:27:43,010
Why do you care, you
have a new roommate now!

297
00:27:46,330 --> 00:27:50,210
You just focus on Sweety,
yeah? The room's all decorated.

298
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,410
Get lost!

299
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:52,450
Come on!

300
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:12,410
Can I say something, Munna bhaiya?

301
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:14,970
Hmm?

302
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,650
You're good at making
others wield the razor.

303
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,570
Are you angry because Compounder
tried to kill your father

304
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,770
or because he failed?

305
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,450
I don't want to shave anymore.

306
00:28:49,450 --> 00:28:50,850
I could give you a sponge bath.

307
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:56,890
I can bathe myself, I'm not a child.

308
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,210
I know you're not a child.

309
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:10,450
You're all grown up, Munna.

310
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,170
Now try to think like an adult too,

311
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:23,290
make sure your friend's
death isn't in vain.

312
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:05,610
Are you just gonna sit there?

313
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,050
Sweety, I...

314
00:30:13,890 --> 00:30:15,450
if you're okay with it

315
00:30:17,410 --> 00:30:18,770
can we not... today?

316
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:23,770
Tomorrow's the Mr
Purvanchal competition.

317
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:25,970
I need to save my strength for it.

318
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:31,650
I mean, if... if you're okay with it.

319
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:40,050
Drink this milk, at
least. It's a ritual.

320
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:42,570
Nah, I got my own ritual.

321
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,930
Just a sec.

322
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,810
Bodybuilders always pop
diuretics before a competition,

323
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,850
gives the muscles definition.

324
00:30:56,810 --> 00:30:57,850
It's mindblowing.

325
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,410
You look nice.

326
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,730
I look even better without this.

327
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,570
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

328
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,490
It's a lot more exciting

329
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,770
in your room, on Kaaleen bhaiya's bed.

330
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:41,050
Let me concentrate!

331
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:04,250
Bauji, I... just...

332
00:32:05,450 --> 00:32:06,970
I was about to bring you dinner.

333
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,410
I was just looking for Raja.

334
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,890
So sexy.

335
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:52,370
You'll win easily.

336
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,690
Who?

337
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,930
Who is it?

338
00:34:14,250 --> 00:34:15,250
Subodh?

339
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:18,290
- Subodh?
- I... it's... it's me.

340
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,010
It's me, grandma. Munna.

341
00:34:22,330 --> 00:34:25,690
- Munna? Are you alright, son?
- I... yes.

342
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:29,170
Subodh hasn't come home for days, son.

343
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:34,170
Yes, I'd... I'd sent him out of town
for some work, he'll be back soon.

344
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:35,730
When will that be, son?

345
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:40,930
He sent this for you.

346
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:44,690
If you need anything,
call me. I'll come.

347
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:47,810
He even left his phone here.

348
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:48,970
Look.

349
00:34:51,250 --> 00:34:52,250
This...

350
00:35:04,530 --> 00:35:05,530
Listen, Pankaj.

351
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:07,890
I don't believe that

352
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,050
Compounder attacked Papa on his own.

353
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:18,250
Surely somebody else must
have been involved too.

354
00:35:20,210 --> 00:35:22,730
You remember he was on his phone
constantly those last few days?

355
00:35:25,850 --> 00:35:26,850
Yeah.

356
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:28,610
Where are you?

357
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:31,250
I'll be there.

358
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:34,850
What do you mean, what are we doing?

359
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:36,690
Throwing back some shots, what else.

360
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:49,170
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome
to this year's Mr Purvanchal!

361
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:57,490
Alright, calm down, everybody.

362
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:59,690
The event starts soon.

363
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:03,970
A huge round of applause
for our contestants!

364
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:11,610
And another round for
our volunteers as well.

365
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:15,570
Flex too hard, and I'll bury you alive.

366
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,690
Sorry, sir.

367
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:19,330
And let's all welcome

368
00:36:19,450 --> 00:36:21,130
Kaaleen bhaiya!

369
00:36:24,730 --> 00:36:25,770
Sir!

370
00:36:45,410 --> 00:36:47,010
Go say hello to him.

371
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,210
Greetings sir.

372
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:20,170
Presenting our contestants!

373
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:26,010
Give it up for...

374
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:27,170
Guddu bhaiya!

375
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:28,330
Give it up for...

376
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:30,530
- Guddu bhaiya!
- Give it up for...

377
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:32,490
- Guddu bhaiya!
- Give it up for...

378
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:33,570
Guddu bhaiya!

379
00:37:33,650 --> 00:37:34,650
Give it up for...

380
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:35,690
Guddu bhaiya!

381
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:37,570
- Give it up for...
- Guddu bhaiya!

382
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:38,650
Give it up for...

383
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,210
Guddu bhaiya!

384
00:37:42,890 --> 00:37:44,050
That was a smart move.

385
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,050
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time

386
00:37:46,130 --> 00:37:48,410
for our first contestant
to take the stage.

387
00:37:48,530 --> 00:37:50,570
Puttan Pathan from Mau.

388
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:02,250
Jonga Mishra of Balia.

389
00:38:12,530 --> 00:38:16,930
Rohit Sharma from Gorakhpur.

390
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:34,850
Sir, you need to come home.

391
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:36,530
There's something you need to see.

392
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:42,130
Well done!

393
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,930
And last, but not the least...

394
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:47,970
our very own Guddu Pandit from Mirzapur.

395
00:38:48,370 --> 00:38:50,450
Go, Guddu bhaiya!

396
00:38:57,490 --> 00:38:58,690
Wow!

397
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,410
Alright, folks, get ready.

398
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,050
The judges are tallying the scores.

399
00:39:46,810 --> 00:39:47,810
Come here.

400
00:39:51,090 --> 00:39:53,370
Something has come up, I need to leave.

401
00:39:55,970 --> 00:39:57,250
Guddu must not win.

402
00:39:57,930 --> 00:39:58,930
Alright?

403
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,410
Okay then.

404
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:03,170
You guys stay.

405
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:04,930
Where's he going?

406
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:16,770
Are you ready?

407
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:18,490
It's time for the winners.

408
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:24,170
Prize distribution by
ex-MLA, Mr Ranjan Tiwari.

409
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:30,330
Third place goes to

410
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:33,650
Lallan Pathak from Bhadohi.

411
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:40,410
Sir, these two were talking up a storm.

412
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,450
Look at the date and time,

413
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,370
an hour after

414
00:40:48,370 --> 00:40:49,930
Compounder attacked you.

415
00:40:54,570 --> 00:40:56,690
Second place goes to

416
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:59,930
Puttan Pathan of Mau.

417
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,250
He's winning for sure.

418
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,890
12 missed calls,

419
00:41:19,850 --> 00:41:23,130
Guddu must've been
eager to know the result.

420
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:31,530
And now for the winner of
this year's Mr Purvanchal!

421
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,170
First place goes to...

422
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:44,770
Jonga Mishra of Balia.

423
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:52,930
What just happened?

424
00:41:53,290 --> 00:41:55,050
There must be some mistake.

425
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,850
First place huh, asshole?!

426
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,690
- Fuck, Guddu bhaiya!
- I am Mr Purvanchal!

427
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:32,170
Stop, please!

428
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:33,330
Motherfucker!

429
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,530
You want the trophy, motherfucker?

430
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,170
Leave him alone!

431
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:50,170
Not a step further, bastard!

432
00:42:53,610 --> 00:42:55,370
Guddu bhaiya, leave him.

433
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:56,770
Guddu bhaiya!

434
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,170
I'll kill you, motherfucker!

435
00:43:02,130 --> 00:43:03,130
Guddu!

436
00:43:22,410 --> 00:43:23,450
Guddu.

437
00:44:13,330 --> 00:44:14,530
I told you

438
00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:18,530
that when the time's right,
I'll hand you the reins.

439
00:44:20,130 --> 00:44:21,610
That time is now.

440
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:29,090
When Guddu and Bablu signed up,

441
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:31,690
they said they were
two bodies and one soul,

442
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:35,810
that they'd come together or not at all.

443
00:44:37,730 --> 00:44:40,010
So, they'll go out together too.

444
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,690
Are you ready?

445
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:45,090
Yes, I am.

446
00:44:46,690 --> 00:44:48,890
You've placed your trust in
me, for the first time ever.

447
00:44:50,410 --> 00:44:51,410
I'll do it.

448
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:55,410
Here, son.

449
00:45:02,970 --> 00:45:03,970
Munna.

450
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,930
And so begins the dance of destruction.

451
00:45:24,650 --> 00:45:28,970
And I won't stop until Mirzapur is mine.

452
