00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:13,770
Students!

3
00:00:14,890 --> 00:00:16,410
Today...

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:22,570
is an important day for our college.

5
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,890
I request you all

6
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:29,650
to think and cast your vote

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:32,050
for the right candidate

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,890
and your college.

[indiscernible whispering]

11
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:20,170
As per the final count,

12
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,250
Golu has won.

13
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:35,090
You've come in second.

14
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,410
Second out of two candidates, sir?

15
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,010
Munna!

16
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,370
- How about a recount?
- Come now, sir.

17
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,930
Give these guys a break.

18
00:01:52,010 --> 00:01:53,810
Was the voting fair and square?

19
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,170
No monkey business, right?

20
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,930
That's it then.

21
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,610
Hey, man.

22
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,250
The students must be
waiting impatiently,

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,570
announce the results, please.

24
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:13,490
Oh, listen.

25
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:16,170
Come here.

26
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,290
Here are some sweets to celebrate,

27
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,690
it's a joyous occasion.

28
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:27,770
- Sir.
- Hmm?

29
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,770
Shouldn't you give Miss
Gajagamini the good news?

30
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:31,906
Y... you want me to tell Golu?

31
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:32,930
Yes, of course.

32
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:35,290
Here, I'll do it.

33
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,490
- No, I...
- Come, give it to me.

34
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:39,250
- No, I'll call.
- Yeah, sure.

35
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,570
- In the diary?
- Yes.

36
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:42,810
Look under 'G'.

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,890
Golu, where are you?

38
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,530
You knew the results were
to be announced today, right?

39
00:02:58,970 --> 00:02:59,970
Congratulations.

40
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:01,170
Well, you've won.

41
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:03,810
Alright, I'll see you then.

42
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,090
So, where is our dear President?

43
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:11,850
She said she's going to Gorakhpur

44
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:14,330
with her brother-in-law and sister.

45
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:16,330
- Oh, I see.
- The whole family, in fact.

46
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,050
Right, of course.

47
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,850
Alright, sir.

48
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,010
- I'll be off.
- What's happened to you, Munna?

49
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,930
You've lost.

50
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:29,010
That's why I'm going to
congratulate the winner.

51
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:31,290
All the way to Gorakhpur.

52
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:34,410
Long live Golu Gupta!

53
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,690
Long live Golu Gupta!

54
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:38,850
Long live Golu Gupta!

55
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:41,130
Long live Golu Gupta!

56
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,490
Long live Golu Gupta!

57
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,130
Bhaiyaji, who are we looking to fuck up?

58
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,330
Not just fuck up.

59
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:28,730
Kill.

60
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,330
Guddu and Bablu.

61
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:40,290
In the jungle, if the lion
cub is not the predator,

62
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:42,530
he becomes prey.

63
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:46,410
Maqbool.

64
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,890
- Follow Munna, just to make sure.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:54,770
Nobody is going anywhere.

66
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,130
Akhanda.

67
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:02,050
You handed Munna your gun,

68
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:04,050
now let him use it.

69
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:07,690
He's a Tripathi.

70
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,410
It's in his blood.

71
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,930
I know you're his father.

72
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,130
But, he must come into his own.

73
00:06:45,570 --> 00:06:47,170
Look a little happy, Golu.

74
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,850
You've won the election. That's huge!

75
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:51,810
That's why I need to
be in college right now.

76
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,706
It makes sense for you
to go since you're family.

77
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,490
Why am I being dragged to
Dimpy's friend's wedding?

78
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,050
Oh, so you're not family?

79
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,130
And did we drag you here, or

80
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,290
did you decide to give
Bablu some company?

81
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,210
Dimpy, don't you start!

82
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,610
Jeez.

83
00:07:11,090 --> 00:07:12,090
Hey.

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,930
Actually, I could use your help.

85
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,250
Help?

86
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,370
You know what this is, right?

87
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,210
Withdrawal from the steroids.

88
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:45,690
You'll be fine in a few days.

89
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:51,570
Come on.

90
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,770
Feeling better?

91
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:56,970
Good.

92
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,450
Let's go.

93
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:08,490
How're you feeling?

94
00:08:08,890 --> 00:08:10,050
I'm nervous.

95
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:11,330
What, why?!

96
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:13,610
- Just be careful, okay?
- Yeah!

97
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,410
Come here, you.

98
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:17,690
You're smudging my lipstick!

99
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:19,730
What's all the excitement about?

100
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:23,290
Uh... Golu won the election!

101
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,890
I knew she would.

102
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,330
She won everyone's hearts
with her very first speech.

103
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,450
Everyone's?

104
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,970
I mean, yes, everyone's.

105
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,810
Congratulations, Golu.

106
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:39,770
Thank you.

107
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:43,890
Usually, you get congratulated
after you've proved your worth.

108
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:47,570
Only in politics is it
the other way around.

109
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,490
So, I'll deserve this congratulations
only after I've done some good.

110
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:53,530
Stop boring us, man.

111
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:55,330
I want another ice cream.

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,490
I'll call for it.

113
00:08:56,730 --> 00:08:58,946
But it's the president's
treat, to celebrate her victory.

114
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,610
Yeah, definitely.

115
00:09:00,770 --> 00:09:03,130
Double scoops all around,
and chocolate for me.

116
00:09:18,850 --> 00:09:20,850
- Looking nice?
- What?

117
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:23,970
Is Golu looking nice?

118
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,930
That's who you're adjusting
the mirror for, right?

119
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,330
I, what...

120
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,850
I was just...

121
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:39,690
You're so quiet.

122
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:42,130
Are you alright?

123
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:53,690
Asshole!

124
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:58,890
Motherfucker.

125
00:09:59,130 --> 00:10:01,210
Won't talk, huh?

126
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:09,770
J... Jasmine.

127
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,370
Miss...

128
00:10:12,730 --> 00:10:13,810
Sir.

129
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,330
Why are you beating us so mercilessly?

130
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:18,770
You found opium on us, right?

131
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:20,210
Take us to court then!

132
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,610
Big shot lawyer now, are you?

133
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,730
Throwing the book at me?

134
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,050
Huh?

135
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:29,890
Cunt.

136
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,730
Move over.

137
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:34,010
Go on.

138
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:38,970
Are you ready to talk?

139
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,890
Or do you want to go another round?

140
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,970
Look here.

141
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:45,770
Sit up!

142
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:51,170
I don't care about the opium.

143
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,050
I care about the suppliers.

144
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:57,410
You deal with Babar Khan, don't you?

145
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,250
Babar Khan works for Guddu and Bablu.

146
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,810
Who do Guddu and Bablu work for?

147
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:07,090
Akhandanand Tripathi.

148
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,370
The buck stops at him, right?

149
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:12,770
King of this jungle, isn't he?

150
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,490
Name him on record, I'll let you go.

151
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:22,290
Yes, Gupta.

152
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,210
Looks lovely.

153
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:47,690
She's arranged rooms for everyone.

154
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,330
Uh, where's the bride's room?

155
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:51,570
That way.

156
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:54,090
You guys get dressed.

157
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:55,930
I'll go meet Shabnam and come back.

158
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:00,610
Shabnam!

159
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:01,930
You're here!

160
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,650
I thought you ditched me.

161
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,010
How could I?

162
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:08,810
I promised.

163
00:12:09,090 --> 00:12:11,250
- How do I look?
- Exquisite.

164
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,690
- Really?
- Really!

165
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:13,810
Can you...

166
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:14,970
I'll do it.

167
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,770
It's upside down.

168
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:21,290
How do I look?

169
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,570
I have something to tell you.

170
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,610
You're going to be a father.

171
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,410
Did you hear me?

172
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:06,450
You're going to be a father!

173
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,930
I've laid out your clothes.

174
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:30,490
Get dressed and come down, please.

175
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,810
Great white sharks have
a fairly long lifespan,

176
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,386
with some of them living up to 70 years.

177
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:56,730
Bauji, are you done?

178
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:57,970
Hmm.

179
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:04,010
They're considered the ocean's
greatest and deadliest predators.

180
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,130
- Raja.
- Yes?

181
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:08,170
Tonight, for dessert...

182
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:11,170
please make some carrot pudding.

183
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:12,770
Consider it done, Bauji.

184
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,930
Ma'am likes carrot pudding too.

185
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:19,050
The Gorakhpur contact is calling.

186
00:15:19,170 --> 00:15:20,170
Pick up, pick up.

187
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:23,370
- Yeah, tell me.
- I just spotted Guddu and Bablu.

188
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:25,370
Bravo, where are they?

189
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,410
- Munna speaking.
- Greetings, sir.

190
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,570
Shove your greetings up
your ass. What's the address?

191
00:15:31,170 --> 00:15:32,170
Celebration Hall.

192
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,450
Medical Road.

193
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:35,370
Gorakhpur.

194
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,930
Coming.

195
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:22,890
Greetings, everybody. Give the
married couple a warm welcome, please!

196
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:27,930
And now for the
highlight of the evening.

197
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,170
Come on, let's go.

198
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,330
Guddu bhaiya, come!

199
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:32,530
What's happened to him?

200
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,290
Take the gift, we'll come.

201
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:36,410
Guddu bhaiya.

202
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:41,810
Come on, you can't just sit there!

203
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,970
- Shabnam...
- Yes, Abbu?

204
00:17:40,530 --> 00:17:42,730
Did you invite them?

205
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:43,570
Yes, Abbu.

206
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:46,050
This is my friend, Dimpy from Mirzapur.

207
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:47,970
You've met her.

208
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:51,050
Those two are her brothers
and that's her sister-in-law.

209
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,770
I'll be right back.

210
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,330
Where's he going?

211
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:01,730
He's gone to the bathroom, let's sit.

212
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,970
Yes, sir?

213
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:22,610
People have forgotten why they fear us,

214
00:18:23,690 --> 00:18:24,970
it's time to remind them.

215
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:27,730
Listen to me carefully...

216
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,250
Hello, Munna bhaiya.

217
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:00,010
Everything is ready.

218
00:20:02,890 --> 00:20:04,850
- Call your contact.
- Yes, sir.

219
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:05,970
- Come on.
- Hold 'em.

220
00:20:23,570 --> 00:20:27,250
Chilli peanut curry. Biryani. Dal...

221
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:29,690
I'll just call Mum and be right back.

222
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,050
Two minutes.

223
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:51,250
I've been watching you,
watching us, motherfucker.

224
00:20:52,770 --> 00:20:53,770
What is it?

225
00:20:55,050 --> 00:20:56,050
Nothing, sir.

226
00:20:57,570 --> 00:20:59,810
Shut up and move.

227
00:21:17,290 --> 00:21:19,210
The bastard isn't picking up.

228
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:31,050
You stay here, block the door.

229
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,610
Be with him.

230
00:21:33,410 --> 00:21:34,970
You, come with me.

231
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:36,970
No fuckups.

232
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:46,370
- Tell me.
- Sir, honestly...

233
00:21:46,490 --> 00:21:47,490
I'm just a guest.

234
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:01,330
You're stunning.

235
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,170
Congratulations!

236
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,730
He's with me.

237
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:15,770
Nobody move!

238
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:18,970
Get down!

239
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,210
Uncle.

240
00:22:33,850 --> 00:22:35,250
Hey, dumbfuck uncle.

241
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:38,770
Stop the music.

242
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,130
Uncle.

243
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:46,890
That's enough now.

244
00:22:47,170 --> 00:22:48,330
Rest a bit.

245
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,290
Or I'll make sure you rest in peace.

246
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:54,570
Munna.

247
00:22:55,370 --> 00:22:56,370
What's all this?

248
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:58,370
Lala!

249
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:01,530
You... here?

250
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:04,090
This is my daughter's wedding reception.

251
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,410
Your daughter?

252
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:10,290
Oh, I had no idea!

253
00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,490
Don't remember receiving an invitation.

254
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,290
That's alright.

255
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:20,250
I'm not going to hurt her.

256
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,770
She's just my... insurance policy.

257
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:29,610
Sweety!

258
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,970
Golu, follow me!

259
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,090
Right, then!

260
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,170
I'm here for Guddu and Bablu.

261
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:47,930
Come on out, boys.

262
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:50,450
Let's not make things messy.

263
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:55,010
Guys, I'm done being patient.

264
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:03,970
Bhaiya!

265
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:13,090
Guddu!

266
00:24:27,890 --> 00:24:28,890
Bhaiya!

267
00:24:33,490 --> 00:24:34,770
- No!
- Son!

268
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,050
Don't shoot, she'll get hurt.

269
00:24:37,370 --> 00:24:38,850
- Dara!
- Hold her.

270
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:40,010
Control yourself.

271
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:43,610
Yusuf, control yourself!

272
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:55,290
Bablu!

273
00:24:56,650 --> 00:24:58,210
Come on out, pal.

274
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:01,930
Your brother has fallen.

275
00:25:02,490 --> 00:25:03,610
Bablu!

276
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,610
Don't listen to him.

277
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:08,730
As you wish.

278
00:25:10,290 --> 00:25:11,450
Guddu!

279
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:16,210
Hey!

280
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,170
Bablu! Bablu!

281
00:25:41,610 --> 00:25:42,730
Guddu bhaiya.

282
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:23,210
It's done, Bauji.

283
00:26:29,410 --> 00:26:32,050
I know about you...

284
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:34,410
and Raja.

285
00:26:41,530 --> 00:26:45,570
It's time for a lesson.

286
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:51,370
The lady of a respectable household

287
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,410
should not look for
satisfaction outside.

288
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,090
Bolt the door and come here.

289
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:23,370
I know you won't try and run.

290
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,010
You can't escape us.

291
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:49,370
Only the Tripathi seed
will fall into you.

292
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:03,290
Munna, what will you do when
Kaaleen bhaiya finds out about this?

293
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:06,730
I'll collect my reward.

294
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,570
He's the one who sent me here.

295
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,370
G...

296
00:29:32,970 --> 00:29:34,290
Gol...

297
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:53,850
Miss President doesn't
know how to fire a gun?

298
00:29:54,650 --> 00:29:56,330
How will you run the college?

299
00:29:57,490 --> 00:29:58,890
Here, hand it over.

300
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,770
I said, give it to me!

301
00:30:21,690 --> 00:30:24,050
Munna! Let them go.

302
00:30:24,930 --> 00:30:26,210
No.

303
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:28,250
No, Munna.

304
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,890
- No.
- No, Munna.

305
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:35,090
What are you pleading for?

306
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,330
- I'm not going to hurt y...
- I'm pregnant!

307
00:30:38,890 --> 00:30:40,490
I'm pregnant.

308
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:18,810
Sweety, I loved you more than life.

309
00:31:23,170 --> 00:31:24,810
And you're carrying...

310
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:27,450
someone else's...

311
00:31:31,010 --> 00:31:32,010
Munna.

312
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:33,370
Munna.

313
00:31:36,570 --> 00:31:38,010
Munna.

314
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:31,330
It's time to punish
your partner-in-crime.

315
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:35,090
Both must suffer.

316
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,170
Pull down his pyjamas and awaken him.

317
00:35:00,250 --> 00:35:03,650
I've always been a disappointment
in my father's eyes.

318
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:14,610
It's impossible to
bear when you're worthy

319
00:35:15,450 --> 00:35:17,810
and others fail to recognize it.

320
00:35:23,650 --> 00:35:25,090
You don't know what it's like.

321
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,050
Bablu.

322
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,850
Munna!

323
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,370
But I've learnt from you, pal.

324
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:50,210
It's just as important to use your
mind, as it is to use your gun.

325
00:35:58,330 --> 00:35:59,730
Now...

326
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,490
time for a demonstration.

327
00:36:03,650 --> 00:36:05,530
Munna! Munna! Munna!

328
00:36:05,650 --> 00:36:07,090
Munna, don't kill him!

329
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:08,890
Don't kill him, please.

330
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,410
Kill me instead.

331
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:13,330
Munna, don't!

332
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,850
Guddu bhaiya.

333
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:28,970
Guddu bhaiya.

334
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,970
Guddu bhaiya.

335
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:48,290
Ah, eyes wide open now?

336
00:36:48,370 --> 00:36:49,370
Watch this...

337
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:26,810
Turn him into the pansy

338
00:37:28,530 --> 00:37:30,770
the world believes him to be.

339
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:41,730
Chop it off.

340
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:53,330
Bring them.

341
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:14,090
Any special reason for this hospitality?

342
00:39:15,570 --> 00:39:16,890
I am...

343
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,530
Akhandanand Tripathi.

344
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,330
We've met before.

345
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:27,410
The Akhanda you met was a businessman.

346
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:33,090
And I am... a don.

347
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,690
Mr Maurya.

348
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,770
You've made your move.

349
00:39:38,890 --> 00:39:40,650
My turn now.

350
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,930
What'll you do, huh?

351
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:44,210
Maqbool.

352
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:45,930
No!

353
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:52,490
The rest of your special team
has met with the same fate.

354
00:39:55,930 --> 00:39:59,290
Mr Maurya, the town you serve...

355
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,010
I own it.

356
00:40:04,570 --> 00:40:10,690
This is turning out to be too
easy. Let's lighten the mood a bit.

357
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,170
Start the music.

358
00:40:12,890 --> 00:40:15,090
Darling, dance.

359
00:40:15,890 --> 00:40:16,890
Dance.

360
00:40:22,330 --> 00:40:23,330
Sorry.

361
00:40:23,450 --> 00:40:24,650
That was an accident.

362
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:33,010
Hey, dumbfuck uncle.

363
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:34,650
Come out.

364
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,330
Faster.

365
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:40,290
Move faster, man.

366
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:41,850
I want you to dance.

367
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,370
Join her.

368
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:46,610
Do you know the Hrithik Roshan step?

369
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,250
The cobra dance!

370
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:58,010
Show some passion.

371
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:03,010
Won't kill you to put some
effort into it, asshole.

372
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:07,410
Yeah.

373
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:14,130
Golu.

374
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,890
Golu.

375
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:19,770
Golu.

376
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:27,930
Pick up the gun.

377
00:41:28,370 --> 00:41:29,370
Pick up the gun, Golu.

378
00:41:36,050 --> 00:41:37,610
Golu, pick it up.

379
00:41:38,890 --> 00:41:42,210
Lala, about this... sorry.

380
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:46,220
But don't worry,

381
00:41:46,221 --> 00:41:47,970
there'll be many people lining
up to marry your daughter.

382
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,650
Listen to me carefully.

383
00:41:58,890 --> 00:42:00,330
Hold the barrel,

384
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:02,530
pull it towards yourself, hard

385
00:42:02,610 --> 00:42:03,610
and let go.

386
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:09,370
Put your finger on the
trigger, the index finger.

387
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,010
Now Golu, take aim and shoot him.

388
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,050
Just do it!

389
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:27,570
Golu.

390
00:42:29,650 --> 00:42:31,370
So, Mr Purvanchal...

391
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:36,250
Let's end...

392
00:44:39,890 --> 00:44:42,130
I want Mirzapur, Sharad.

393
00:44:43,490 --> 00:44:45,130
At all costs.

394
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:20,000
