1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,180
Do you believe in God?

2
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,580
God doesn't give a fuck.

3
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:11,260
Yes, I knew...

4
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:17,860
how they have fucked you over
for 20 years.

5
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,580
Sometimes, I feel like I am God.

6
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,300
It's my story.

7
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,780
Everyone else is playing their part in it.

8
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,100
And I connect them together.

9
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,300
Bunty.

10
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,780
Where is Bunty?

11
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,900
Check inside your asshole.

12
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,460
- Listen.
- Yes, sir.

13
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:32,780
I want Sartaj.

14
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,340
- Today. Right now.
- Yes, sir.

15
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:38,540
I don't know how this world
came into existence,

16
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,460
but I do know how it will come to an end.

17
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,940
Okay, all right. Move back, move back.

18
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,580
It's a gruesome murder.
Must have been an expensive watch.

19
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,140
Expensive enough to get him killed.

20
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,500
Any witnesses?

21
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,700
None.

22
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,940
Sir, it's time for your hearing.

23
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,580
Parulkar will be pissed if you're late.

24
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,460
Just say what Parulkar wants you to.

25
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,500
Junaid had a weapon.

26
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,500
A homemade gun.

27
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,900
We warned him to surrender.

28
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,700
But he responded by firing...

29
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,140
at Constable Raut.

30
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:55,380
Constable Raut was shot and he fell down.

31
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:59,780
The boy tried to run away,

32
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:03,460
and Mr. Parulkar went after him.

33
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:09,300
We had the area sealed.
He couldn't have escaped.

34
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:15,060
He pointed the revolver at Mr. Parulkar.

35
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,260
Mr. Parulkar immediately warned him
to put it down,

36
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:21,860
but Junaid was going to pull the trigger.

37
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,660
Before he could fire...

38
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,500
Sir, before he could fire,
Mr. Parulkar fired three rounds at him.

39
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:01,180
What the fuck were you doing?

40
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,740
Did you forget what we told you?

41
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:04,740
Tell me.

42
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,580
- Are you going to turn us all in?
- What's happening?

43
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:10,060
Majid?

44
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,580
He was an 18-year-old kid.

45
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,740
Is there an age limit
to become a terrorist?

46
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,100
We could have arrested him.

47
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:27,460
Is he new here?

48
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:32,300
He was surrendering.

49
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,900
There's so much filth
in this city, Sartaj.

50
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:38,580
- We can't always follow procedure...
- Can you say that to his father?

51
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:40,660
Have you ever solved a case?

52
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,500
Do you want to be
the next Ramakant Jadhav?

53
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,940
- Google him, he tried to testify too.
- Majid...

54
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:50,380
Go see a doctor.

55
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,220
We'll talk tomorrow.

56
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,140
Okay.

57
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,780
Don't come.

58
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:04,100
Tomorrow's report will state
that you killed Junaid. Then what?

59
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,380
It's a good thing Megha left you.

60
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,260
He plays tennis.

61
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:05,700
Ever played tennis?

62
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,380
Ms. Megha is looking at us. Shall we go?

63
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,020
I won't ever forget

64
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:23,500
Neither will I

65
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,900
Once... Dad decided to take us
to the Golden Temple.

66
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,620
It was a big deal for us.

67
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:39,180
- Visiting Amritsar...
- Is the Golden Temple made of gold?

68
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,460
Listen.

69
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:42,140
The day we had to leave...

70
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,260
Dad was summoned to the police station.

71
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,700
There had been an accident.

72
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:54,380
A car had run over a beggar kid.

73
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,900
Someone had to go to the hospital.

74
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,420
Anyone could have gone.

75
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,820
But Dad canceled the trip to Amritsar.

76
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,940
I cried for days.

77
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:16,500
I stole a 10-rupee bill
from Dad's wallet and burned it.

78
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,340
Back in 1990.

79
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,140
Mom slapped me later.

80
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,980
You know what my dad said?

81
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:33,460
"I was meant to go and see that kid."

82
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,820
I wanted to be like my dad.

83
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:44,940
A good policeman.

84
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,620
Sir, you worry a lot.

85
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Parulkar has the Inquiry Commission
in his pocket.

86
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:02,420
It doesn't matter what you do
or say at this point.

87
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,940
I was in the street... blocking the exit.

88
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,500
He came running towards me...

89
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:11,420
unarmed.

90
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,820
- He was in his late teens.
- Sir...

91
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,780
- He started crying when he saw me.
- Sir...

92
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,380
Sir, save me!

93
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:21,140
Parulkar came from the other side.

94
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,140
He's surrendering, sir!

95
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,980
I yelled out that he was surrendering...

96
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,140
but he shot him.

97
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:40,020
Sir, everything will be fine
once you solve a big case.

98
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:42,180
How will that happen?

99
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:47,940
In the last ten years, all I've managed
to do is catch Sonu, a pickpocket.

100
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,260
Sir,

101
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,140
do you believe in God?

102
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:00,580
Who is this?

103
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,860
Speak up, motherfucker. Who is this?

104
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,620
I want to tell you a story.

105
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,140
Go ahead.

106
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,420
- Who was it?
- I don't know. Some asshole.

107
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,140
Should I trace the number?

108
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,620
Fuck!

109
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,740
Forget about God.

110
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,180
Do you believe in magic?

111
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:56,740
Sometimes, I feel like my life is magical.

112
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,020
Are you crazy?

113
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,420
Why did you end up in the police force?

114
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:06,860
You wanted to be like Gavaskar,
but you're handling Tendulkar's security.

115
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,100
Who is this?

116
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,940
You have to save your city.

117
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,940
I heard you love this city.

118
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,940
Who is this?

119
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
An old friend of Dilbagh Singh.

120
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,380
How do you know my father?

121
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:30,020
Listen.

122
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:33,660
Your destiny will change.

123
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,660
- You'll change my destiny?
- We'll change each other's.

124
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,500
How?

125
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:44,940
If you tell them who called...

126
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:48,500
they'll forget about Sonu, the pickpocket.

127
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,460
Are you one of Ravi Pandit's guys?

128
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,340
Ravi Pandit is a little shit.

129
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,180
I wouldn't fuck with your sleep
for that nobody.

130
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:15,700
Stop bullshitting. Who are you?
Do you have a lead or not?

131
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,580
They're going to kill me.

132
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,860
I can't trust anyone in this city.

133
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:23,980
Then I remembered Dilbagh Singh.

134
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,900
Who's going to kill you?

135
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,900
How do you know Dilbagh Singh?

136
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,660
Mr. Sartaj, how I know him...

137
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,660
is not that easy to explain.

138
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:45,140
When I was 10 or 11 years old...

139
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,940
this day was decided.

140
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:52,780
This very moment... our connection...

141
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:56,100
you, Dilbagh Singh and I.

142
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,940
I could see my destiny in the water.

143
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,260
Ever since I was a kid, I've felt like
my life was a story from the scriptures.

144
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:08,860
Like the whole world, including my father,
was a part of my story.

145
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:25,340
The drought lasted for a thousand years
before Sage Gautama meditated

146
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,260
and manifested the River Ganges.

147
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,220
In my village,
the Ganges was known as the Godavari.

148
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,060
My father was a priest there,

149
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,740
but he was nothing more than a beggar.

150
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,100
Please help me.

151
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,100
Ma'am, help me.

152
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,500
Dad, is God everywhere?

153
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,900
Of course. He's everywhere.

154
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:56,660
He's in every grain of rice in this bag.

155
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:58,220
But he doesn't beg.

156
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:01,340
My father's weakness disgusted me.

157
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,660
That's when I decided
that I would be the master of my fate.

158
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:12,060
Sir, the DOT is tracing the number.

159
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:14,940
He's somewhere near the Metro Theater.

160
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,020
Tell me more.

161
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,100
My mother...

162
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,220
she was very affectionate.

163
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:29,660
I don't know how my dad found her.

164
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:30,980
Come here.

165
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,580
When it was dark...

166
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,820
she was the light in our lives.

167
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,860
How is it? Beautiful, right?

168
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,660
She always made herself beautiful
for that beggar.

169
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,100
Mom.

170
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,660
Mom, where did you get this from?

171
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,940
I knew this dream wouldn't last.

172
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:08,180
While my beggar father slept,
my mother stayed awake...

173
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:12,980
and she slept while he was awake.

174
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,700
She was only truly alive when he was gone.

175
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:20,260
Her world would come alive then.

176
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:27,060
What are you doing?
Are you crazy? Ganesh is sleeping.

177
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:28,980
So what? I want to sleep with you.

178
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,940
Come back when Ganesh is at school.

179
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:35,460
There's no school tomorrow. It's Sunday.
I want to do it now.

180
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:38,100
What are you doing? What if he wakes up?

181
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,540
Let him wake up.

182
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,900
You're going to hit me?
You son of a bitch!

183
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,380
Do you have the courage? You fucker!

184
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,260
Watch your mouth or I'll hit you.

185
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:04,180
Some of my childhood memories
are still fresh.

186
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,100
Why are you crying?

187
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,780
Because I tore your shirt?

188
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:13,500
Your whore of a mother
can buy you a new shirt every day.

189
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:19,060
And some of it feels like
it never happened.

190
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,820
Like it was a part of my past life.

191
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:15,260
It feels like yesterday
when I was running madly.

192
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:17,820
From the fields, from my home,
from the Godavari,

193
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:20,100
from my father's chanting,
and from his God.

194
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,420
And it feels like a lifetime

195
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,100
since I saw my mother.

196
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:34,980
What is religion?

197
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,260
The mother or the father?

198
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:40,300
Whatever it is, I was free of it now.

199
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,700
I needed a new religion.

200
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,540
Bombay.

201
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,780
What is it, sir?

202
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,660
Are you trying to find me?

203
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,180
Why would I be looking for you?

204
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:23,020
I'm hungry. I want eggs.

205
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,140
Should I get you a chicken?

206
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:30,140
Yes, I'm at the Metro Circle.
Do you know the name of the building?

207
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:33,460
Sir, he's somewhere close by.

208
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:37,420
The next street has the best Anda Pav.

209
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Opposite Kyani.

210
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:42,060
I'm right there.

211
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:45,340
Come, let's eat together.

212
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:00,100
You'll find Sunil there.
Tell him I say hi.

213
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:03,060
He chops onions really fast.

214
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,900
Are you fucking around
with a signal scrambler?

215
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:08,620
I have a story to tell,
so I need your time.

216
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:11,420
- So I took you for a ride.
- I heard your story.

217
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,620
Your mom was a whore
and your dad was an asshole.

218
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,220
Watch your mouth, sir.

219
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,420
- Do you know who I am?
- A small-time thug

220
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,940
with a small dick and no balls.

221
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,740
Call a doctor
and stop fucking around with me.

222
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,780
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.

223
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:31,700
My first case,

224
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:36,500
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

225
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:42,700
Look at the records to know
if I am a man or a god.

226
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:53,780
RCN number 215578, 18th December, 2006.

227
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,260
My first case,

228
00:23:55,460 --> 00:24:00,260
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

229
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,820
My first case,

230
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,900
IPC 435, 28th March, 1984.
Kailashpada Police Station.

231
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:09,740
Look at the records to know...

232
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:12,580
Fuck, we're screwed!

233
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,460
Greetings.

234
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,620
I am speaking from Balochistan.

235
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:47,980
There's word
that a faction of ISI has gone rogue

236
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,100
and is smuggling fake currency into India.

237
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:55,780
They are planning something disastrous
against India with Hizbuddin's support.

238
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,380
I'm asking you to send help.

239
00:24:57,460 --> 00:25:00,020
If you can get some Indian support
for our freedom,

240
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,660
I can give you some names.

241
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,420
Sir, we're closed.

242
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,300
I told you that I spoke to Mr. Parulkar.

243
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,780
Come back in the morning.
I need to enter it in the register.

244
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,940
It's an unusual situation.

245
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,420
You'll get a letter
from the DCP's office tomorrow.

246
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,060
Did you hear that?

247
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:23,940
He mentioned Kailashpada Police Station.
Did you hear that?

248
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,420
He's been missing for 17 years.

249
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,140
He hasn't been in India for 23 years.
It can't be him.

250
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:32,140
He has 158 murder cases against him.

251
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:35,180
He fucked both RAW and ISI
before disappearing.

252
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:38,340
- Where are the classified files?
- In that corner. Row number 30.

253
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,860
He must be crazy to come back.

254
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:44,540
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to hell.

255
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:03,100
215578.

256
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:21,860
215578.

257
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,620
"Ganesh Eknath...

258
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,580
Gaitonde."

259
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:01,100
Are you frightened?

260
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,460
What will you do now, Mr. Sartaj?

261
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:08,540
Why did you call me?

262
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,820
How can I tell you if you won't listen?

263
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,700
Where have you been for the past 15 years?

264
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,780
Singapore? Malaysia?

265
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,980
Right here in Zone 13.

266
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:26,100
Sir, it's a trap. Call for backup.

267
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,420
How will that help me?
I'll be back to doing the same old shit.

268
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,420
Parulkar and Majid will be pissed.

269
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,820
Fuck Majid.

270
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:41,420
- How far is it from there?
- Twenty minutes.

271
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:44,580
That's some speed.
Are you in love with Bombay now?

272
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:46,700
We live like cockroaches.

273
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,620
What's there to love?

274
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,100
Try going out at night.
If I didn't love this city...

275
00:27:53,060 --> 00:27:56,660
I wouldn't have built my empire here
in the garbage dumps.

276
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,380
This is what Bombay is now.

277
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,540
An empire amongst garbage dumps.

278
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,140
That's the beauty of this city, sir.
Anything is possible.

279
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:09,980
In 1977, Indira Gandhi's Emergency
reigned over the country.

280
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,940
The government was sterilizing its people.

281
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:27,220
But Bombay... Bombay didn't slow down.

282
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,340
Everybody found work here.

283
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,300
I benefited from being a Brahmin's son.

284
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,420
SATYANARAYAN SHUKLA
UPPER-CASTE HINDU HOTEL - PURE VEGETARIAN

285
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,460
Shukla Seth, Hindu Hotel.

286
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,700
A regular meal for 8 rupees,
a deluxe meal for 12 rupees.

287
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,980
Hurry up!

288
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:49,340
They used baking soda in the rice
and fake ghee in the dal.

289
00:28:57,340 --> 00:29:00,020
Why are you touching the rice
with your dirty hands?

290
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:02,260
This is the Hindu Hotel!

291
00:29:03,660 --> 00:29:06,740
People don't come here
because we serve good food.

292
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:11,340
They come because everything here
is clean and pure.

293
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,380
Everyone from the cook to the waiter
belongs to the upper caste.

294
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,780
Religion found business in purity.

295
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:22,060
I made sin a business.

296
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,300
Bombay had a booming market for drugs.

297
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,380
I wanted to dig in.

298
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
Mandrax.

299
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,380
One pill costs 10 rupees.

300
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,860
Two for you and eight for Mathu.

301
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,380
Don't lick it, swallow it.

302
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:41,500
Okay.

303
00:29:42,700 --> 00:29:44,820
Mandrax gives you the ultimate kick.

304
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,660
The craving for it will grow
with every passing day.

305
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,980
It's the best business.

306
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,460
Mathu taught me how to sell.

307
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:58,140
If the guy had red eyes and dark circles,
he would definitely buy Mandrax.

308
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:23,820
I could have been high on Mandrax,
or under a spell.

309
00:30:24,380 --> 00:30:28,460
Shukla Seth beat me black and blue,
but I felt no pain.

310
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:32,700
Bastard! Son of a whore!
I told you, no bullshit here.

311
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:37,500
Ever since then,
I've known that I am Ashwathama.

312
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,940
I'm immortal.

313
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:48,860
Sir, you haven't given me my salary.

314
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,620
You don't do any work,
and then you ask for a salary?

315
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,020
Work for three more months.

316
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,660
I haven't gotten anything
for two months, sir.

317
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,980
You will.

318
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:10,020
My dickhead boss owned a scooter,

319
00:31:10,460 --> 00:31:12,660
but he drove it like it was Isa's red car.

320
00:31:12,780 --> 00:31:15,700
I'll tell you about Isa later.

321
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,980
I fantasized about his red car.

322
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,980
I wanted it.

323
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,580
- Eat.
- Mathu told me to be brave.

324
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,180
Being brave meant becoming a sinner.

325
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:31,780
Don't think so much.
Think of it as a vegetable,

326
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:33,860
not a dead bird.

327
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:37,460
Rip it and eat it like a jackfruit.
Try it.

328
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:44,420
A chicken bone in a Hindu hotel
can cause more damage than any gangster.

329
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:47,740
It's been happening
since pre-independence days.

330
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:51,220
To create a rift amongst the Muslims,
dump pork in a mosque.

331
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,300
To incite riots amongst the Hindus,

332
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:56,020
dump beef in a temple.

333
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:59,500
And for a devout Hindu, a bone was enough.

334
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,900
From the Hindu Hotel I learned
how religion can fuck anyone over.

335
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,500
I had much more to learn.

336
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:38,500
I had to meet Mathu's boss, Salim Kaka.

337
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,700
Salim Kaka.

338
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:43,220
An Afghan bull,
the king of gold smuggling.

339
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:44,860
My second father.

340
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:50,780
Are you done? Now give me the tip.

341
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:54,660
Close your eyes and chant
"I am Lord Brahma."

342
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:56,100
What?

343
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,980
I am the alpha and the omega.

344
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,860
Everything will become clear.

345
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,260
Your thoughts... will turn into reality.

346
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:08,380
If God wasn't real, how would we
have conceived the idea of him?

347
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,780
God talks to us through stories.

348
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:15,820
Our lives...

349
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,940
are the stories.

350
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,940
Someone is monitoring the call.

351
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,460
What?

352
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:41,780
You have 25 days to save your city.

353
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,540
Twenty-five days?
What will happen in 25 days?

354
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:46,940
- Where are you?
- I don't know, sir.

355
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:48,340
I'm almost there.

356
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,140
- Sorry, sir.
- Don't hang up!

357
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,460
Fuck!

358
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,100
It's auto-erasing from a remote server.

359
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,460
- I don't think we'll get anything.
- We have this, right?

360
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,780
I don't know what it is.

361
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,020
Listen, was there ever a garbage dump
in Zone 13?

362
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,740
Garbage?

363
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:29,940
- Yes...
- He said...

364
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,220
There was one, sir. A long time ago.

365
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,980
Around 25, 30 years ago.

366
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,220
There's a mall there now. DMD Mall.

367
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,380
You can try using dynamite,
but this door won't open.

368
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:12,460
Save your city, Mr. Sartaj.

369
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
Sit on the chair.

370
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:35,100
Eager to nab me, aren't you?

371
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,980
- What will happen in 25 days?
- Everyone is going to die in 25 days.

372
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:42,140
Only Trivedi will be safe.

373
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,780
Who's Trivedi?

374
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,900
An asshole. Fuck him.

375
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:50,500
Why will he be safe?

376
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:55,580
My father is going to fuck everyone,
but I'll save Trivedi.

377
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:58,460
Which father? The village priest?

378
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:00,580
No, sir. I have three fathers.

379
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,980
All three of them fucked me up.

380
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:06,180
The first one instilled fear in me,
the second gave me guts.

381
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,940
The last one,
the one I loved the most, betrayed me.

382
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,340
How?

383
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,820
The first father was a priest.
I didn't want to be like him.

384
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,540
The second father, Salim Kaka,
whose eyes told me,

385
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:22,780
"Gaitonde, if you kill me,
you'll become immortal.

386
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,580
You are Ashwathama!"

387
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,580
Hop on.

388
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,460
Sit down.

389
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,500
Don't utter a word.

390
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:46,300
I told you not to do it.

391
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,860
Salim Kaka was also known
as the ball-breaker.

392
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:57,540
He'd squeeze the balls so hard
that the brain would burst

393
00:38:57,620 --> 00:39:00,060
and the person would be dead in minutes.

394
00:39:00,700 --> 00:39:04,020
Salim Kaka had done this 14 times.
Mathu was petrified.

395
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,980
So was I, but I had made up my mind.

396
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,820
You want to be brave, go ahead. I won't.

397
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,740
You told me to be brave.

398
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:30,500
This box has so much money,
you'll never have to sell Mandrax again.

399
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,620
Do you even know what being brave means?

400
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:38,620
Those six assholes over there
know what it means.

401
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,940
But will they do it?

402
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,580
You're out of your mind.

403
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,420
Put it down.

404
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:31,700
It's empty now, but it has killed
two people. Keep it safe. It's done.

405
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:35,420
Salim Kaka may have been a smuggler,
but he was actually a demon.

406
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:39,100
My conscience told me
to free this fucker's soul.

407
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:47,860
We had learned
the tricks of smuggling gold.

408
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,820
Now Salim Kaka was of no use to us.

409
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,180
You!

410
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,700
Motherfucker!

411
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:19,260
Why did you throw it, motherfucker?

412
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:34,260
Hit this motherfucker!

413
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:41,780
Motherfucker!

414
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,100
Enough!

415
00:42:54,260 --> 00:42:55,220
Enough!

416
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:57,620
Stop it, he's dead!

417
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,860
Everyone was scared.

418
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,100
They looked at Salim Kaka's corpse
with utter disbelief.

419
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,660
No one said anything to me.

420
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,980
No one shot me. No one praised me.

421
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,860
Does this happen to you?

422
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,940
When you kill someone,
you visualize yourself as that person.

423
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:20,700
I've seen myself
in every person I have killed.

424
00:43:33,740 --> 00:43:36,100
Gaitonde, open the door!

425
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,260
Your game will be over soon.

426
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:40,140
Don't do this, sir.

427
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:44,500
My mind has never been so fucked up,
and I have more to tell.

428
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,580
We'll listen to the rest of it in jail.

429
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,900
There will be nothing left in 25 days.

430
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,100
Come on!

431
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,860
- Harder!
- Harder!

432
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:10,340
Raise the shovel and hit it!

433
00:44:13,260 --> 00:44:15,580
Dilbagh Singh introduced me
to my third father.

434
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,180
Go!

435
00:44:18,420 --> 00:44:21,220
- What?
- I called you up to return his favor.

436
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:23,860
Who did my father introduce you to? When?

437
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,380
Gaitonde!

438
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,620
What did you say?

439
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:43,820
Come with me peacefully.

440
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:49,380
Who did Dilbagh Singh introduce you to?

441
00:45:53,460 --> 00:45:54,660
Put the gun down!

442
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:54,100
It's not over yet, Mr. Sartaj.

443
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,820
I told you, I am Ashwathama.

444
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,380
I won't die.

445
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:05,540
I'm not going anywhere
till the game is over.

446
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:08,260
Come on, Mr. Sartaj.

447
00:47:08,780 --> 00:47:11,140
Now we'll be together when it destroys us.

448
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:17,460
Holy shit!

449
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:23,580
Do you believe in God?

450
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:47,660
