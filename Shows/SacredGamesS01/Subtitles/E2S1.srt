1
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,400
What's this, Katekar?

2
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:12,600
Did Mr. Sartaj kill him?

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,880
Why are you laughing?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,120
- How did he get the tip?
- How would I know?

5
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:22,040
- Don't lie.
- I don't know anything.

6
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:25,840
How did he surface after 15 years?

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,880
- Do I look like an astrologer to you?
- Why are you getting angry?

8
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:34,440
My wife nags me at home.
I don't need it here.

9
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,920
Sartaj?

10
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,000
- What's going on?
- I received a tip, sir.

11
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,240
Why didn't you tell me?

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,920
I had no idea, sir.
I realized when I got here.

13
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,320
Go to the police station.

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,800
Majid will take over the case.

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:25,960
It's my case, sir.

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,080
Do you have any idea what happened here?

17
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,960
Ganesh Gaitonde has returned.

18
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:39,960
There's the press,
there are other agencies.

19
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
Have you ever dealt with them?

20
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,160
"It's my case."

21
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,120
Just look at yourself.

22
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,560
<i>You can't get away so easily, Mr. Sartaj.</i>

23
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,040
<i>You'll be back to hear my story.</i>

24
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,200
Here, on this day...

25
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:37,520
I give you my word.

26
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,880
This is Bipin Bhonsle's promise.

27
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,200
In the next four weeks...

28
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,640
we'll make a water train
operational across Maharashtra.

29
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,320
Every village and district
will have water.

30
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,000
Long live India. Long live Maharashtra.

31
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,040
We have the home minister here,
and to welcome him,

32
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,040
I invite our Member of Parliament,
Mr. Rajendra Joshi.

33
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,600
I ask him to present our honored guest,

34
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,400
our home minister, Mr. Bipin Bhonsle,
with a bouquet...

35
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,640
- When did it happen?
- Last night.

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,280
Who's the DCP?

37
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,880
Parulkar.

38
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,200
Call him.

39
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Ma'am, to your right.

40
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:49,720
Mr. Karan!

41
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:52,720
- Mr. Karan!
- Ma'am, please!

42
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,960
This is my last movie with you.

43
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,480
You're the worst actor
I have ever worked with.

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,240
Why? Are you going to star
in <i>Superheroes</i> with Ranbir?

45
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:04,120
What do you think about the woman?

46
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,080
Looks like an escort.

47
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,800
When did this become a RAW case?

48
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,560
It's an internal matter.

49
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,120
- Yes, Mr. Bhonsle.
- Did one of your men kill Gaitonde?

50
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,200
<i>No... he killed himself.</i>

51
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,200
I want a detailed report on this.

52
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,600
How did the RAW get involved?

53
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,880
One of my men is with them.

54
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,640
<i>I don't care about that.</i>

55
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:54,080
If he helps the RAW officers,
you will face the consequences.

56
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,560
Don't worry, Mr. Bhonsle.

57
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:59,680
I'm not worried, Parulkar.

58
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,400
The Naxal threat in Gadchiroli
is something to worry about.

59
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,160
<i>You could be useful there.</i>

60
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,040
<i>Understood?</i>

61
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,320
Yes, sir.

62
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
I can't get through to Jojo.
I want my file.

63
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,520
If my name surfaces, everyone's will.

64
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,960
<i>Constable Katekar got a bulldozer...</i>

65
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,440
<i>and we broke down the wall.</i>

66
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,240
<i>It was around 9 a.m.</i>

67
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:09,240
<i>I went in first.</i>

68
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,560
The first thing I saw was...

69
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,840
a woman's dead body.

70
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,280
She had been shot in the face.

71
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,160
I went ahead,

72
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,760
and saw Gaitonde sitting...

73
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,480
in a corner, on the chair.

74
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,480
He was pointing the revolver towards me.

75
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,560
I gave him a warning...

76
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,960
but he shot himself.

77
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,400
Why did he call you?

78
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,720
I asked him the same question, sir.

79
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,960
He said he needed to talk.

80
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,960
Your father, Constable Dilbagh Singh...

81
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,000
was a cop
when Gaitonde was active in Mumbai.

82
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,400
He was a good man, sir.

83
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,680
Any more details about the 25-day warning?

84
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
Who? When? Where? Did he say anything?

85
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,200
No, sir.

86
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
He just said that Mumbai
will be destroyed in 25 days,

87
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,520
- and to save it.
- Did he give any proof...

88
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,640
to make us take him seriously?

89
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,720
Maybe he had an agenda.

90
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,200
He killed himself, sir.

91
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,080
In front of me.

92
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,520
Nobody lies when their life
is about to end.

93
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:31,880
Did he mention ISI,
directly or indirectly?

94
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,200
No, ma'am.

95
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,440
Foreigners, neighboring countries,
enemies, currencies?

96
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,440
No, ma'am.

97
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:39,840
Not even once.

98
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,520
Did he say anything about the lady
whose body was found there? Like...

99
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:48,440
Ma'am, we've checked our database.
There's no match.

100
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,920
Gaitonde was a womanizer.

101
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
- He was always with someone.
- I don't think she was an escort.

102
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,760
He said everyone will die...

103
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,080
except for Trivedi.

104
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,840
Who's Trivedi?

105
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,640
I don't know, sir.

106
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,600
Take the report from Sartaj.

107
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,960
<i>What do you think?</i>

108
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:18,440
<i>He's a low-performing officer.</i>

109
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,760
<i>He needs anxiety pills to fall asleep.</i>

110
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,480
<i>He's put on weight in the last two years.</i>

111
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,080
<i>He's hungry for attention.</i>

112
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,960
<i>I don't know how much we can trust him.</i>

113
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,920
Why did Gaitonde come back?

114
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,480
- Is his old gang still active?
- Is there anyone we could speak to?

115
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,680
Bunty.

116
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,480
His oldest aide.

117
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,400
He runs a construction business
and is a TV producer.

118
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,040
Find him.

119
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,440
Did you decode it?

120
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
Do it quickly. E-mail it to me.

121
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,040
What were you saying about that woman?

122
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,240
She was shot in the face.

123
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,360
That shows that the killer was angry.

124
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:30,120
And if he was so angry,
she was either his friend or his enemy...

125
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,640
not just an escort.

126
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,320
Can you get more details?

127
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:41,800
What happened?

128
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:47,120
High-profile cases like these
ruin small-time officers like me.

129
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:52,600
Find out more and call me.

130
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:55,640
<i>Sir, I got a call.</i>

131
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,480
I investigated.

132
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,320
You have all the details.

133
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,040
If you support the department
in the Bengali Bura case...

134
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,560
the department will support you.

135
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,600
Why, sir?

136
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,360
For killing Gaitonde.

137
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,200
You haven't even read the report yet.

138
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,640
Surrender your weapon and go home.

139
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,320
Sartaj.

140
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,200
<i>Gaitonde said a name.</i>

141
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:03,920
Trivedi.

142
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,960
Is it the same Trivedi?

143
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,840
What did he say about Trivedi?

144
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
Everyone will die except Trivedi.

145
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,320
- Is that it?
- Yes.

146
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:04,120
Hey. Turn right.

147
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:08,080
People think that only cops take bribes.

148
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,480
Sir.

149
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,960
- Yes?
- Sir, my son...

150
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,320
Shamsul. He hasn't returned home.

151
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:19,240
You told me to come back later.
It's been days now.

152
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:24,080
- Are you from Bengali Bura?
- Yes, sir.

153
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,200
He must have gone to join Al-Qaeda
or ISIS. Go check.

154
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:29,840
Stop bugging me.

155
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:32,040
Get lost!

156
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,520
So annoying.

157
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,800
- Yes, sir.
- Why did he call me?

158
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,280
<i>Who, sir?</i>

159
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,160
Gaitonde.

160
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,960
He could have called anyone.

161
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,240
Why me?

162
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,920
Who knows, sir?

163
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,920
He must have known your father.

164
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,280
- Open it.
- Okay, sir.

165
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,920
<i>I said you'd be back.</i>

166
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,200
<i>My story is like a scorpion,
and it has stung you.</i>

167
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,960
<i>Until you hear the story
of where I came from,</i>

168
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,880
<i>you won't understand
this religious conflict.</i>

169
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,280
<i>We buried our gold in the jungle
outside Gopalmath.</i>

170
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,920
<i>We didn't know what to do with it.</i>

171
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,000
<i>Mathu and I would stare at it
like morons every day.</i>

172
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,440
<i>We thought we would be murdered
if we took it somewhere.</i>

173
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,640
<i>And if we left it there,
it would be stolen.</i>

174
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,640
<i>I even suspected Mathu.</i>

175
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,760
<i>I don't know if the leopard came
to save Mathu or to tell me...</i>

176
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,320
<i>that I was not only the king of the city,
but of the jungle as well.</i>

177
00:18:55,800 --> 00:19:00,800
<i>When I looked into its eyes without fear,
I felt like I was God.</i>

178
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,080
<i>It told me to think big.</i>

179
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,440
<i>Bombay is filthy rich. Ravage it.</i>

180
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,120
<i>In 1985, the mother died
and her son became the prime minister.</i>

181
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,320
<i>He got involved in the Bofors scam.</i>

182
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,480
<i>I thought if the prime minister
was dishonest</i>

183
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,520
<i>how could I walk down a straight path?</i>

184
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,920
<i>The plan to win over Bombay
was clear in my mind.</i>

185
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,760
<i>First, find a rich man
who can launder your money.</i>

186
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:48,880
<i>Paritosh Shah. My friend, brother,
treasurer, everything.</i>

187
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:53,920
<i>Money made us very close.</i>

188
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,400
<i>One wife, three kids, and a tiny shop.</i>

189
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,240
<i>The fucker worshiped his safe.</i>

190
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,240
<i>Money was his religion.</i>

191
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:07,920
<i>And I knew how to make
a religious man my follower.</i>

192
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:11,680
<i>The next step in the plan
was to start a gang.</i>

193
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,120
<i>In Nagpada Masjid Bunder,
there was a gang down every alley.</i>

194
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,640
<i>So, I came to Kailashpada.
I found new members here.</i>

195
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,480
<i>Bada Badriya, tall and muscular.</i>

196
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:25,520
<i>He prayed five times a day
and worked out ten times.</i>

197
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,160
<i>And his brother, Chotta Badriya.</i>

198
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:30,880
<i>He couldn't keep it in his pants,
but he was very loyal.</i>

199
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,840
Hey, take your brother.
He threw up on my bed.

200
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,200
You motherfucker!

201
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,800
Fuck off!

202
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,000
<i>I started the gang and then waited,
like a cheetah.</i>

203
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,440
<i>Now we needed a sharp mind.</i>

204
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,160
<i>Someone who knew
every shady motherfucker in the area</i>

205
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:52,200
<i>- and would direct me to the treasure.</i>
- You asshole!

206
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,680
Don't be a dick to the waiter.

207
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:56,800
If you bullshit me,
I'll throw you out with the trash.

208
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,280
Get the fuck out of here.

209
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,440
Get out. I don't want any trouble.

210
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,320
- You don't wear lipstick.
- I didn't put much on.

211
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,520
No one's told me to wear it before.

212
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,680
- I love red.
- I love blue.

213
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,640
You fucker! You're drunk, get lost.

214
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,560
Get out of here and don't come back.

215
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,520
Get out of here
or I'll hit you in the face!

216
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,640
I'll use my sandals.

217
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,000
Are you going or not?

218
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,400
- Ganesh Gaitonde.
- So? Should I worship you?

219
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,960
- Get out.
- I saw your place.

220
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,160
So what?

221
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,320
- I'm a regular there.
- Everyone is. Now get the fuck out.

222
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
- I'm coming for a drink.
- Get lost!

223
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,200
I'll come for a drink.

224
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,960
<i>Then I met Kanta Bai.</i>

225
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,840
<i>She was brave,
but she wouldn't help me at first.</i>

226
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:46,680
<i>I started a moonshine business with her
to convince her.</i>

227
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:50,400
<i>Her liquor was top-notch.
Her business grew tenfold.</i>

228
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:52,520
<i>Then she told me everything.</i>

229
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,720
<i>Kanta Bai said Bombay's riches
were in its garbage.</i>

230
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,480
<i>There was a fucking garbage mafia.</i>

231
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,480
<i>Gopalmath's garbage dump
stretched five kilometers long.</i>

232
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:10,760
<i>It churned out 70 lakh rupees
worth of garbage every day.</i>

233
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:15,400
<i>Everything was on sale. Chairs, drums,
the broken neck of a guitar, everything.</i>

234
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,560
<i>And Momin was the king.</i>

235
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:23,520
<i>My final plan was to replace Momin.</i>

236
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:27,000
I want to build a house in Gopalmath.

237
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,760
In the garbage.

238
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,960
And I'll do it for sure.

239
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,880
The land you're talking about...

240
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,000
where Gopalmath is...

241
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,960
you were right.
It belongs to the government.

242
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:47,000
The auction will take place here.

243
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,000
If you want your name on the list...

244
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:55,040
you'll have to pay up.

245
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:01,400
Double the amount.
We'll have to bribe everyone.

246
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:05,000
I want ten plots.

247
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:06,200
You'll get them.

248
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:09,280
All ten. It will be done.

249
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,080
I'll have the papers ready.

250
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,760
Pay the money,
and I'll prepare the documents.

251
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,720
Okay? I'm off.

252
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,760
You'll get the money.

253
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,200
But if you try to fuck me around,

254
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,960
I'll chop you up and feed you to the dogs.
I promise you.

255
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:34,920
<i>There was a part of Mumbai
within my reach.</i>

256
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:38,760
<i>And there was another part,
alive, glittering, and unattainable.</i>

257
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:45,960
- Where are you going?
- Inside. Where else?

258
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,760
Do you know what's inside?

259
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:49,680
What?

260
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,960
It's the boss's den, man.

261
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,040
It's not for beggars.

262
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,880
Go get wasted in some shady local bar.
Understood? Get lost.

263
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:02,240
Friend, we're not beggars.

264
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,280
We have a lot of money.

265
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:08,520
If that could get you in,
half of Bombay would be in there.

266
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:11,040
Know your place and fuck off.

267
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,040
<i>Just as the Taj Mahal enchants people
when they see it for the first time,</i>

268
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,360
<i>I felt the same when I saw Isa
for the first time.</i>

269
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:21,040
<i>The only difference was that people
take photos of the Taj Mahal.</i>

270
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,880
<i>I wanted to bring Isa down.</i>

271
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,920
Who was that guy who just went inside?

272
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:37,640
Suleiman Isa. Have you heard of him?

273
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,400
<i>Suleiman Isa.</i>

274
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:45,600
<i>I couldn't get my mind off
his nice car and the pretty lady.</i>

275
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,840
Hey, get out of the way!

276
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,600
Listen, you asshole...

277
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,320
all your talk of buying my land...

278
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
will get you killed.

279
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,760
Shut up and get the fuck out of here.

280
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,280
If I ever see you again...

281
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:03,480
Fucker!

282
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,360
Police Inspector Parulkar.

283
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,080
Congratulations.

284
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:27,520
Your first case has been registered
at the Kailashpada Police Station.

285
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:29,000
IPC 435.

286
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,120
Do you have a lot of money?

287
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,080
Is it too heavy?

288
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,360
Where do you live?

289
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,440
Gopalmath.

290
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:40,360
That's a garbage dump.

291
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:47,680
Fucking swine. No wonder you stink.

292
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:52,840
Around here, I see beggars like you
end up dead every day.

293
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,000
Leave Kailashpada.

294
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,920
What did you think?

295
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:09,200
That you would come here
and become a big man with your money?

296
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:14,480
Millions of people come here every day
and creep into the sewage like bugs.

297
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:18,120
They get squashed.

298
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,800
If you want to stay alive,
you need to be brave.

299
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,680
If you want to be a big man,
you need to be brave.

300
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,160
You're packing?

301
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,760
You can come if you want to.

302
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:51,640
Where are you going?

303
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,480
Back home.

304
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:57,880
Why?

305
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,760
Are you done?

306
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,240
Let it be.

307
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:13,200
Are you scared? Tell me.

308
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,120
- Tell me.
- Yes, I'm scared!

309
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,240
I don't want to die in a brawl.

310
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,920
<i>Mathu left for his village.</i>

311
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,200
<i>Parulkar had spotted me.</i>

312
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,800
<i>My name was in his files now.</i>

313
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:35,000
<i>The municipality guy, Talpade,
took my money and told Momin about me.</i>

314
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:40,960
<i>The municipality was Momin's.
Parulkar was Momin's.</i>

315
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,040
<i>Kailashpada was Momin's.
I was losing everything.</i>

316
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,520
Momin?

317
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,080
He wants us both to leave.

318
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,760
<i>The municipality guy, Talpade,
was the first to die.</i>

319
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,480
<i>Then there was the fuel.</i>

320
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:25,360
<i>Momin's business, worth 20 crore rupees,
was reduced to ashes overnight,</i>

321
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,840
<i>and his body was never found.</i>

322
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,960
<i>The smoke hung thick over Bombay
for five days.</i>

323
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,880
<i>From Borivali to Byculla, everyone knew
that Kailashpada had a new boss.</i>

324
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,760
<i>Ganesh Gaitonde.</i>

325
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,960
Hello, Mom.

326
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,480
You haven't slept yet?

327
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,200
<i>We both have this problem.</i>

328
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,600
<i>We don't get enough sleep.</i>

329
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,760
<i>Your father was the only one
who slept soundly.</i>

330
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,400
Switch off the TV
and you'll be able to sleep.

331
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,440
<i>Gaitonde is all over the news.</i>

332
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,800
<i>Weren't you there?</i>

333
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:22,640
<i>Some of your officers were there,
including Parulkar.</i>

334
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,840
<i>He's in your department, isn't he?</i>

335
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,000
- Yes.
<i>- It would've been nice to see you.</i>

336
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,920
<i>I thought I missed it.</i>

337
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:34,960
No, Mom, you didn't.

338
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,120
I wasn't there.

339
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:41,000
<i>When are you coming home?
It's been seven months.</i>

340
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:42,920
Yes, Mom. I'll come home soon.

341
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,160
- I'll talk to you later. Bye.
<i>- Bye.</i>

342
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,720
Fucker.

343
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,360
Is your Istanbul posting confirmed?

344
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,320
All the action is there.

345
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,640
Doesn't seem like it.

346
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:30,720
What do you mean?

347
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
Still obsessed with working in the field?

348
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:39,280
If a man wants to work
in the field, it's passion.

349
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,120
If a woman wants to, it's obsession.

350
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,000
You're a good analyst,
do what you do best.

351
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:21,760
Did you find out about Gaitonde's man?
Bunty, the one in construction?

352
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,600
All his offices
and bank accounts have been sealed.

353
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,120
Let's see, we need to push more.

354
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,200
He must be waiting for things to settle.

355
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,400
If he comes out now,
a rival gang will kill him.

356
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,160
Markand, there is no rival gang.

357
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:46,160
If I say something,
you won't take it badly?

358
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,280
You don't want to prove yourself
in the field.

359
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:57,360
I think you're doing this
because your father died in the field.

360
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,800
I've been hearing that since the academy.

361
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,480
It's been 16 years.

362
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,240
Listen, take me to the office.

363
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:03,920
Easy!

364
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:08,200
Oh, dear. It's all black and blue.

365
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,960
It's infected.

366
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,720
When is the government going to give you
the money for the treatment?

367
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:20,600
I inquired yesterday. The documents
have been submitted to the ministry.

368
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,800
"The documents have been submitted
to the ministry."

369
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:26,320
It's been ten years since 26/11.

370
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,720
Why did you take the bullet?
Why did you risk your life?

371
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,600
And what did you get?
A trophy and that's it.

372
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,280
My dear, you've been telling me this
every night for the past ten years.

373
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,640
Am I sitting in the police station now?

374
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,200
I am here, in our house, with you.

375
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,640
Why are you nagging me?

376
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,480
I'm nagging?

377
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,640
That Sikh has performed
black magic on you.

378
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:55,280
- Hey.
- What "hey"?

379
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,000
Do you get overtime
to wander around with him?

380
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:03,120
His wife left him and now
you're stuck with him all day.

381
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,320
- Yes, sir.
<i>- I've found her car.</i>

382
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,840
I'll send you the license number.

383
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,800
Find out who the owner is.

384
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,920
Okay, sir.

385
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,120
What do you want?

386
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,400
I have a little work matter. It's urgent.

387
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,800
You're screwed, and now
you want me to be screwed as well.

388
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:41,400
I didn't come here to beg.

389
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,000
It's important,
and it won't take more than five minutes.

390
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:49,240
Mr. Sartaj is stuck. This is a huge case.
We just need a little help.

391
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,440
Hurry up!

392
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,600
- Holy shit.
- Does it hurt?

393
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,320
I don't know what to do.

394
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,120
My wife says that a trip to Shirdi
will fix everything.

395
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:11,160
We don't have the money
to pay for better treatment.

396
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,480
Did Parulkar say anything?

397
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,400
"Lie in court and you'll be fine...

398
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,040
speak the truth and get fucked."

399
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:24,680
Then do it, sir.

400
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:27,520
- Lie?
- Yes.

401
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,240
These Bengali Bura Bangladeshis...
Motherfuckers.

402
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,320
Why fight the department for them?

403
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,880
Bastards, who knows what they eat?

404
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:41,560
They drive like crazy during Eid.

405
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:44,360
That's how they are. Motherfuckers.

406
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,800
There's nowhere to breathe in Mumbai.

407
00:41:47,360 --> 00:41:49,160
- Is it that suffocating?
- Yes.

408
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,560
And when Zoya Mirza's film premieres?

409
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,840
You're first in the line.

410
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,280
That's different, sir.

411
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:22,240
Katekar.

412
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:26,920
Holy shit.

413
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:52,600
