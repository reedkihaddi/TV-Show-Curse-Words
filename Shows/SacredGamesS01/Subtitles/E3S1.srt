1
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:16,520
It's done.

2
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,680
I'm leaving. Keep an eye on him.

3
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,160
Where is he?

4
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Mr. Sartaj.

5
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,280
Fuck!

6
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,240
Fuck you!

7
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,080
Majid, don't be a traitor.

8
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:59,080
I'm following
the RAW officer's instructions.

9
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:01,160
Stop bullshitting.

10
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,400
Check the room.

11
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,080
I said shut up.

12
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,800
Just go and check.

13
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,400
You got that?

14
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,200
If I tell Parulkar
you're here despite being suspended,

15
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:28,800
you will be fucked.

16
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,200
Stop licking Parulkar's ass, Majid.
You were the best at the academy.

17
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,440
Worry about your own ass. I'll show you.

18
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,120
Okay, call him.

19
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:44,280
Tell the RAW officer what you were doing
while I was solving the case.

20
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,360
Long live India, sir.

21
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,320
Yes, sir.

22
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,400
Looks like all of the fake currency
is stored here.

23
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,360
- How did you trace it?
- I tracked her car.

24
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,760
Can you find out more
about Jojo Mascarenhas?

25
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:22,200
Ma'am, what's going on?

26
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:33,720
We have intel on an operation
involving fake currency.

27
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,400
Gaitonde's warning
could be linked to this.

28
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,840
I've been suspended from work.

29
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,320
If Mr. Parulkar finds out about this,
I'll lose my job.

30
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,320
You wouldn't be here
if your job meant so much to you.

31
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
Find out what Jojo was doing there.

32
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,320
What was Gaitonde talking about?
The 25-day warning?

33
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,240
And Trivedi... Who is Trivedi?

34
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,840
There are too many questions,
and we are running out of time.

35
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,840
<i>Ma'am, it's an emergency.</i>

36
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,520
Sartaj.

37
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm sending a team to seize the currency.

38
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,880
What happened?

39
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:29,320
Did anyone go inside?

40
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:34,520
Let me see him.

41
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,760
What the fuck?

42
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,240
She won't leave
until I throw this on her head.

43
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,240
What the fuck...?

44
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,520
Yes, sir.

45
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,880
<i>I came to Mumbai because this is where
my dreams could be realized.</i>

46
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:47,480
<i>I'm friends with top models,
actresses, and movie stars.</i>

47
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,440
- Who is that girl?
- Must be one of her hoes.

48
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,360
Clients.

49
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,480
Holy shit! Sir, that's her...

50
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,600
- Nayanika.
- Who?

51
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,400
Nayanika Sehgal. She's a TV star.

52
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,200
<i>The Super Eye.</i>

53
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,400
She is famous.

54
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,120
- Her?
- Yeah.

55
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,520
<i>Your mother is a fan of my show, right?</i>

56
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,160
Yes, she watches every episode.

57
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,840
And you?

58
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll watch your show now.

59
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,080
Do you want an autograph?

60
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:11,760
Who are you?

61
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,240
Inspector Sartaj Singh.

62
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:15,920
Mumbai Police.

63
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,920
I want to ask you a few questions.

64
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,320
Jojo is my manager. She handles my work.

65
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,480
What kind of work?

66
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,480
Well, TV, commercials...

67
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,520
I just shot a commercial
for Scooter incense sticks.

68
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,440
And?

69
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:39,920
What else?

70
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,680
Does she send you to clients?

71
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,760
Who did she send you to?

72
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:58,680
Nayanika...

73
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,640
we want to help you.

74
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,480
Don't be scared.

75
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,000
Was Ganesh Gaitonde one of your clients?

76
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,200
Then who?

77
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,880
Jojo has been murdered.

78
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,840
She's dead.

79
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,080
You don't have to be
scared of her anymore.

80
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,400
I'm not scared of her, Mr. Sartaj.

81
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,320
Then who?

82
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:55,400
She gets calls
from different numbers every night.

83
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,400
All the numbers are different. No repeats.

84
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,880
Did she say anything?

85
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,560
She was too scared. She said nothing.

86
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,280
Sir, I spoke to the retired constables.

87
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,160
They said that your father
had nothing to do with Gaitonde.

88
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,240
Here she comes.

89
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:24,800
The gangster you are trying to reach
is currently unavailable.

90
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,760
The gate is closed.

91
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,720
Please try again later.

92
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,160
To link your Social Security Number...

93
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,240
Shut up.

94
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,840
What a place, sir!

95
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:05,120
Look at this fucker's bed.

96
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,720
My entire family can sleep on it.

97
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,080
Velvet handcuffs.

98
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:17,560
Just like the ones the cops use.

99
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,680
Have you ever used these?

100
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:27,080
We don't even have room for a bed.
Where would we keep these?

101
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,920
People have weird fantasies.

102
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,000
If I take these home,
my wife will hang me from the ceiling.

103
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:36,280
She will hang me upside down
and set me on fire!

104
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:44,280
Holy shit! What is all this?

105
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,160
It's called S&M.

106
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,640
What?

107
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,560
These are used for pleasure.
They are tied to the bed.

108
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,960
You can have pleasure in pain
and pain in pleasure.

109
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:02,640
Let's get these for our police station.
Pain and pleasure at the same time.

110
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,680
Who is this psychopath?

111
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:55,200
<i>Bunty. Some called him a pervert
and others, an animal.</i>

112
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,720
<i>But no one really understood him.</i>

113
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,960
<i>His veins had hatred running through them.</i>

114
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:03,640
<i>Especially for Muslims.</i>

115
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,440
<i>He triggered the Hindu-Muslim
conflict in my gang.</i>

116
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,640
<i>It was Bunty who created all the chaos.</i>

117
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:12,760
Hit harder!

118
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:17,640
Hey, asshole... someone posted your bail.

119
00:17:22,080 --> 00:17:23,400
Hey, sign here!

120
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,000
Hey!

121
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,440
Why are you running away from me?
Are you embarrassed?

122
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:42,200
Are you late for your clients?
Do you work round the clock?

123
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:47,840
You should thank me for bailing you out,
you motherfucker!

124
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:53,120
How many men did you fuck to bail me out?

125
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,960
I got into this because of you.
Have you ever earned a penny in your life?

126
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:02,680
You are lucky
we are at the police station, bitch!

127
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,720
Boss wants to see you.

128
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,040
Who is that?

129
00:18:23,080 --> 00:18:26,240
Do you only use talcum powder?
Don't you have perfumes?

130
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:29,160
It has a fragrance. I'll spray it later.

131
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,840
Mr. Isa only uses imported perfumes.

132
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,000
He gets loads of it...

133
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
every month.

134
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:50,840
Bitch.
You don't deserve imported perfumes.

135
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Boss, I've brought the guy from the mill.

136
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,880
You guys can continue.

137
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,560
You will not fuck around
in my area... without my permission.

138
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,160
Yes, boss.

139
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,680
Gather your men.

140
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,920
He will tell you what to do.

141
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,400
Boss, I know what to do.

142
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,440
My men are ready to die for you.

143
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,720
Learn your job first.

144
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:44,560
I will ask you for favors later.

145
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,520
Yes, boss.

146
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,240
- What's your name?
- Bunty.

147
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,920
My official name is Deepak Shinde,
but everyone here calls me Bunty.

148
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,280
<i>Every asshole in the city
knew me as the king of trash.</i>

149
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:04,680
<i>But I was way ahead of them.
I had a beast like Bunty on my side.</i>

150
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,240
<i>It was time to mess with Isa.</i>

151
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,080
What was it you said last time?

152
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,440
"Know your worth."

153
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:30,120
<i>Kukoo... She was magical.</i>

154
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:34,280
<i>Whoever won over Kukoo, ruled Bombay.
That's what I heard.</i>

155
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,520
<i>Isa was invincible,
nothing could kill him.</i>

156
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,600
<i>To defeat him, I had to take Kukoo away.</i>

157
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:53,640
Hey, baby.

158
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,160
Come with me.

159
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,400
- Where will you take me?
- To paradise.

160
00:22:58,480 --> 00:22:59,880
I am paradise.

161
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,400
Those who want to see paradise...

162
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:03,840
they come to me.

163
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,680
Besides, you look like shit.

164
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,800
What do you do?

165
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,880
I have just begun.

166
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,600
Where do you want to go?
I'll drop you off.

167
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:19,760
Do you know the guy in the red car?

168
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:20,880
Suleiman Isa.

169
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,560
If he finds out what you just told me...

170
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,480
he will chop you into pieces.

171
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,200
Do you belong to him?

172
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:35,920
- Kukoo doesn't belong to anyone.
- Prove it. Come with me.

173
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,080
Isa's reign is over.

174
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:40,160
It's my time now.

175
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:41,920
Think about it.

176
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:45,840
The movie has just begun...

177
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:51,840
and I've met my girl
in the very first scene.

178
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,600
If you come with me,
we'll have a great time.

179
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,160
If the girl leaves with her man
in the first scene,

180
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,840
the movie will be a flop.

181
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,400
The film can only be fantastic

182
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,200
when the bad guy
loses the girl to the good guy.

183
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:12,760
You want to be the good guy, right?
So, stop being a jerk.

184
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,400
Kukoo only falls for action.

185
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,720
<i>That's when I realized why the leaders
of Bombay were smitten by Kukoo.</i>

186
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:26,200
<i>She wasn't the prize.
She was the road to victory.</i>

187
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:31,360
<i>I didn't know then
that the Bombay we were fighting for</i>

188
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,120
<i>would never belong to anyone.</i>

189
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:39,840
<i>Isa and I would destroy it,
and with it, I would lose my life.</i>

190
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,520
<i>I was obsessed with Kukoo,</i>

191
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,720
<i>and the nation was obsessed
with its temples.</i>

192
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,840
<i>Meanwhile, my third father
was wreaking havoc in others' lives</i>

193
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,360
<i>before coming into mine.</i>

194
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:53,920
Atapi and Vatapi were demon brothers.

195
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,200
Atapi...

196
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,680
targeted wandering travelers

197
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:02,680
by inviting them to his home
with great affection.

198
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:05,000
"Please come to my home.

199
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:09,120
Perhaps you're hungry.
I'll offer you tasty food."

200
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,040
BREAKING NEWS

201
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,960
<i>The travelers would agree happily.</i>

202
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,720
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

203
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,360
BABRI MASJID'S GATES UNLOCKED IN AYODHYA
MUSLIM COMMUNITY IN TURMOIL

204
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,920
<i>...Vatapi, with the help
of mystical and demonic powers,</i>

205
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:21,800
<i>would assume the form of a goat.</i>

206
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,560
<i>- What form?
- A goat's.</i>

207
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:24,520
<i>A goat's form.</i>

208
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:30,960
<i>The guests would devour the goat meat
and feel contented.</i>

209
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:36,160
<i>At that point, Atapi would call out
to his brother.</i>

210
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,600
<i>"Vatapi! Come out!"</i>

211
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,360
<i>Immediately,</i>

212
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,760
<i>Vatapi would tear open
the guest's stomach and emerge.</i>

213
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:52,480
<i>The traveler would die.</i>

214
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,680
<i>And then the brothers,
Atapi and Vatapi, would rejoice.</i>

215
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:03,240
<i>This is what religions are all about.</i>

216
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:11,560
<i>Entice the travelers, feed them,</i>

217
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,680
<i>and then kill them.</i>

218
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,080
<i>Jews and Muslims, Christians and Muslims,</i>

219
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,400
<i>Hindus and Muslims...</i>

220
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,160
<i>All are victims of Atapi and Vatapi.</i>

221
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:36,680
<i>- Whose victims?
- Atapi and Vatapi's.</i>

222
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,280
<i>Atapi and Vatapi's.</i>

223
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,600
<i>All of them.</i>

224
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,160
I brought this for you.

225
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,520
Are you a big man now?

226
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,600
Very big.

227
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:04,920
You are, indeed.

228
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,160
Look closely.
Parveen Babi wore this in the movie <i>Shaan</i>.

229
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,160
It's fake.

230
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,360
It's genuine. The same piece of jewelry.

231
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:32,640
Where did you get it?

232
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,920
I found it for you.

233
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:40,920
I killed a few merchants.

234
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,320
I can do anything for you.

235
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,920
How did you know that I like Parveen Babi?

236
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,400
The same face. The same eyes.

237
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
The same figure. Exactly the same.

238
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:02,560
Do you like Parveen Babi?

239
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,800
If I didn't,
I wouldn't have dared to do this.

240
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:07,480
I watched the movie <i>Deewaar</i> eight times.

241
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,760
My dream is to see you
light two cigarettes

242
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:14,920
and offer me one in my bed.

243
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,800
You have the same pain in your eyes
as Parveen Babi's.

244
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,880
- What kind of pain?
- The same pain.

245
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:36,720
Everyone sees you,
but no one understands you.

246
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,240
But I do.

247
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:43,640
Totally.

248
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:16,640
Move, motherfucker!

249
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,280
Go! Go!

250
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:50,400
<i>We waited a long time,
ready for Isa to exact his revenge.</i>

251
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,480
<i>But he never showed up.
Because he was a bastard.</i>

252
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,320
<i>He was in no hurry.</i>

253
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,120
<i>He had a plan to strike back harder.</i>

254
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:10,920
<i>Kukoo fell into my lap
like she had always been mine.</i>

255
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:15,320
<i>The news was all over Bombay
that finally Isa had competition.</i>

256
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:23,000
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, GAITONDE SIR

257
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:00,320
<i>As a kid, I never celebrated my birthday.</i>

258
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,320
<i>But that year,
even Bollywood star Mithun's impersonator</i>

259
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,720
<i>danced at my party.</i>

260
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:39,080
<i>And that was the first time
I saw Bipin Bhonsle.</i>

261
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:42,440
<i>He ran a local Hindu committee
in Kailashpada,</i>

262
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,240
<i>but dreamt of forming
his own political party.</i>

263
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:53,120
<i>Nobody thought this imbecile would become
the next home minister.</i>

264
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:05,600
That garland is worth 5000 rupees.
And he didn't even ask for my name.

265
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:07,920
It was a waste of time.

266
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,600
This is Mumbai. Anything is possible here.

267
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:18,600
A filthy dog is going to take a shit
on the whole city.

268
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,640
Bipin Bhonsle, sir.

269
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:27,840
I will be contesting the election...

270
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,400
<i>Bhonsle, Parulkar,
and the other asshole Trivedi.</i>

271
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:37,040
<i>If I knew how badly
they would fuck me over later,</i>

272
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,440
<i>I would have killed them that very day.</i>

273
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,000
<i>What else did you find in Trivedi's house?</i>

274
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,280
Everything was in order.

275
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:41,600
The papers were on the table.
The milk was in the refrigerator.

276
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:49,280
If there was no milk in his house,
it would mean something was wrong.

277
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,600
You wouldn't understand.

278
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,600
Where do I put this?

279
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:09,000
Here, sir.

280
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,640
Trivedi.

281
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:21,520
An old friend of Bhonsle's.
This is a 25-year-old photograph.

282
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,320
Find out where he is.

283
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:27,560
Yes, sir.

284
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,080
The RAW officer has kept Sartaj busy.

285
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,480
Let her.

286
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,480
He'll be back to fix your nose.

287
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,360
Majid.

288
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,600
Can this 5-star hotel be attacked?

289
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,880
I mean, for serving this.

290
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,640
Not while I'm here.

291
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,680
I heard that you're working
on a big superhero film.

292
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,080
But... you're the real superhero.

293
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:29,440
Actually, I wanted access
to Jojo Mascarenhas' apartment.

294
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,160
It's not under
the Mumbai police's jurisdiction.

295
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:39,080
The RAW officers have seized everything.

296
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,160
What do you want from there?

297
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,080
Small-town girls tend to make mistakes.

298
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:54,080
Something like that.

299
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,840
Please, two minutes.

300
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,080
We have Bunty Sharma's record.

301
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,760
Violence against women, rape...

302
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:42,440
There are many charges against him.

303
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,240
But he's still a free bird, and I am not.

304
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,200
I'll say it again, cooperate with us.

305
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:54,640
Tell me what you know about Bunty.

306
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,800
I know Bunty is the producer of your show.

307
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,160
Don't worry.

308
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,600
I won't let anyone hurt you.

309
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:15,440
Bunty always talks about leaving Mumbai.

310
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:19,960
He says he has one last job to finish
before leaving.

311
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,280
What kind of job?

312
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:23,480
I don't know.

313
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:24,800
A job for Gaitonde?

314
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,840
No, he never mentioned that name.

315
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,720
Did he mention a date?

316
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,800
No.

317
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,840
He said he would leave in 20-25 days.

318
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,400
Where to?

319
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,440
He didn't say.

320
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,320
He says he'll take me with him.

321
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,280
And?

322
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:49,600
I don't want to go.

323
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,760
You won't.

324
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,920
We'll help you...

325
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,440
if you help us get Bunty.

326
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,960
You don't have to do much.

327
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:13,880
The next time he calls you,
inform us before you go to him.

328
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,400
- No.
- Even he...

329
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,560
- I don't want to go.
- Listen...

330
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:19,600
Listen. Don't be scared.

331
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,000
He won't learn about it.

332
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,120
Ma'am, why are we sending her back
to Bunty instead of protecting her?

333
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:44,400
If Bunty calls her and she doesn't go,
he'll get suspicious and go into hiding.

334
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:50,440
- There has to be another way.
- We don't have the time.

335
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,840
We only have 21 days.

336
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,920
We'll keep her safe.

337
00:40:57,320 --> 00:41:00,560
The camera in this bag
will live-stream everything.

338
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,200
Make sure not to cover its view.
Keep this next to you. This way.

339
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,040
Zoya!

340
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,360
Karan!

341
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,080
Talent manager?

342
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:41,080
She was your pimp.
I saw her here so many times.

343
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,920
How would it feel...

344
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:46,240
if tomorrow's headlines read:

345
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,280
"Zoya, the self-made star from Kanpur,

346
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,040
who is hard-working and independent...

347
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,000
was Jojo's client"?

348
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,080
<i>He called.</i>

349
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:57,920
<i>I have half an hour.</i>

350
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,040
<i>Sartaj?</i>

351
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:04,840
I'm coming.

352
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,760
