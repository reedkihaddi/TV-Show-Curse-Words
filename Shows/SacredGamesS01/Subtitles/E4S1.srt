00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:31,720
Why don't you glue your head to the TV?
Don't let your food sit. Eat it.

2
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,840
Get me a cable box.
I'll record it and watch later.

3
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:42,800
- Did you apply for the computer classes?
- Yes.

4
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,720
What's the class called?

5
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,080
What is it?

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,000
Magi-Tech.

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,080
- Mom!
- Look at me!

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,280
Start attending those classes, or else
I'll bash your head into the TV. Got it?

9
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,520
- Let it go.
- Why should I let it go?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,200
Does money grow on trees?

11
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,960
Motherfucker.

12
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,960
Give me the phone.

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:04,720
- It's Mr. Sartaj.
- Give it to me!

14
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:06,880
- Let me check...
- Practice what you preach.

15
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,160
- I'm switching it off.
- Nag, nag, nag.

16
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,200
<i>His car has arrived at the bungalow.</i>

17
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,320
Nayanika's camera is in place.

18
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:44,080
<i>She's waiting for Bunty.</i>

19
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,680
He's there. He's sitting next to her.

20
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:15,160
Do they bring your food on time on set?

21
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,160
Everyone on set
was talking about Gaitonde.

22
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,800
Your friend?

23
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,200
My friend?

24
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
Who told you that?

25
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,360
Did I ever say Gaitonde was my friend?

26
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,360
- Did I?
- No.

27
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,640
- I didn't, right?
- No.

28
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,760
<i>Then who told you?</i>

29
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,600
<i>Tell me!</i>

30
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,320
Ma'am, what's happening?

31
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,080
<i>I asked you a question, didn't I?</i>

32
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,760
Who told you?! Who asked you about him?!

33
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,680
Do you go to the set to work or to gossip?

34
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,360
What's happening?

35
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:24,440
<i>Tell me! Who told you?</i>

36
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
<i>Who told you?</i>

37
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,440
<i>Fucking...</i>

38
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,520
- Get out of there.
- What's happening in there?

39
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,080
<i>Motherfucker!</i>

40
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,520
<i>He's seen the camera! Get out!</i>

41
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,440
Mr. Sartaj Singh.

42
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:09,600
Weren't you the last person
to see Gaitonde alive?

43
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,360
He had such shitty luck.

44
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,600
Anything in his pockets?

45
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,120
Destroy it.

46
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
Anything else?

47
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,240
- Keep this.
- Okay.

48
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,160
Return this when he leaves.
It'll be useful on traffic duty.

49
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,360
- What's this?
- I also found this.

50
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,840
Don't eat this shit.

51
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:02,840
Your manhood will shrink
from this... to this.

52
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:03,760
Really?

53
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,400
Then I'll have to beat women
to feel like a man.

54
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:10,720
Are you a man?

55
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,880
Let me see.

56
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,680
You are Superman, right?

57
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,560
Show me.

58
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,040
Why did Gaitonde come back?

59
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
What will happen in 25 days?

60
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:32,760
Straight from Sonu, the pickpocket,
to Gaitonde.

61
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,600
What crazy luck you have.

62
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,280
Anjali Mathur.

63
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
She's a senior officer from Delhi.

64
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,760
So?

65
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,560
Do you want me to marry her?

66
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,400
She'll talk to you.

67
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,960
It's for your own good.

68
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,480
Don't get sucked into this.

69
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,960
I'm getting out.

70
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,280
After tonight, I'll be far away
from this shit.

71
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,680
Got it?

72
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,440
Now, fuck off.

73
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
She's coming with me.

74
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,560
She's not.

75
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:23,160
She's going away. Far, far away.

76
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,600
Take him away. Be respectful.

77
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,640
Treat him well.
He's come here for the first time.

78
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,800
- Move!
- Treat him extremely well.

79
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,240
Let's go.

80
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:35,240
Stop!

81
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
Get out!

82
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,680
Give me your phone.

83
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,120
<i>Where are you?</i>

84
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,480
With the target, in Wadala.

85
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,720
Near Bhakti Park Station.

86
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:04,440
He's stopped here.

87
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,760
Take me to Wadala.

88
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,160
He's going to kill the girl.

89
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,880
Two trucks have stopped.

90
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:25,160
<i>The trucks are following his car.</i>

91
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,720
He put the girl in a different car.

92
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,120
Follow the target, I'll look for the girl.

93
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,080
She's my informer.
I promised to protect her.

94
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:42,000
I'll follow the girl.
Send me the license number.

95
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Fuck!

96
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,480
Where's my money?

97
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,480
Fuck you, Katekar.

98
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:08,160
Got it.

99
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,400
Yes.

100
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
What about the rest?

101
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,560
Interpol and RAW are out to fuck us.

102
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,960
It will be difficult
to get you out of the country.

103
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:34,480
Didn't you promise me...

104
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,440
that you'd get me out of the country
before June 17th if I give you the stuff?

105
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,760
- Yes, we still have 20 days.
- Really?

106
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:44,760
You think Bunty's an idiot?

107
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,640
Do I look like a dickhead to you?

108
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,960
I'm in this because of Gaitonde.
I have nothing to gain here.

109
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:58,520
- I have nothing to do with your shit.
- Kishore, start loading the stuff.

110
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,160
Hey! I'm not done talking!

111
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,280
I'll deal with you later, motherfucker.

112
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
I'll shove an umbrella
up your ass and open it.

113
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,600
I'm warning you.

114
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:12,800
Got it?

115
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:14,920
Let's go.

116
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:55,040
What should we do with him, sir?
He's a cop.

117
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,840
Burn his clothes and body separately.

118
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,360
<i>Rajiv Gandhi did the same thing.</i>

119
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,120
<i>He dealt with Shah Bano
and the country separately.</i>

120
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,160
<i>In 1986, Shah Bano's husband divorced her.</i>

121
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:11,240
<i>She took him to court and won the case.</i>

122
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:16,760
<i>But our former PM, Rajiv Gandhi, a pussy,</i>

123
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:18,360
<i>overturned the court's judgment</i>

124
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,920
<i>and threw Shah Bano to the mullahs.</i>

125
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,800
<i>The Hindus criticized him for this.</i>

126
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:27,480
<i>He had the </i>Ramayan<i> show
aired on TV to please them.</i>

127
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,960
<i>Every Sunday morning, the entire country
was glued to the TV.</i>

128
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,040
<i>Bunty was no exception.</i>

129
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:41,400
<i>Bunty understood that religion
could open many doors.</i>

130
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,640
<i>The prime minister's trick worked wonders.</i>

131
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:54,600
<i>Until your motherland...</i>

132
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,720
<i>is taken back from those pigs...</i>

133
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,880
You motherfucker,
give me back my cassette!

134
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,200
Give it back!

135
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:10,920
Motherfucker!

136
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:14,160
- Why the fuck are you breaking it?!
- Shut up, motherfucker!

137
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:15,800
What were you listening to?

138
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,720
Talk about destroying mosques,
motherfucker?

139
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,240
Have you lost it?
Thinking of destroying mosques?

140
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:26,680
I will listen to whatever the fuck I want!
I don't need your permission!

141
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,960
- Show me what you can do! You dickhead!
- Wait, I'll show you.

142
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,520
Your sister is waiting for me.

143
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,000
Fuck you, you cunt!

144
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,200
You asshole! Fucking cunt!

145
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,200
You motherfucker!

146
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:41,920
What are you doing?!

147
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,120
Fuck around in here again
and next time it'll be boiling oil!

148
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:48,960
Why are you into these Muslim guys?
Does he even get an erection?

149
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:51,400
Keep working, motherfucker.

150
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,440
He sticks it in deeper
than you ever could.

151
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:56,720
You bitch, I swear...

152
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,240
Forget it.

153
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,400
Stupid bitch.

154
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:06,720
I'll kill you and that Muslim guy.

155
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,440
Fuck off.

156
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,960
- You fucking whore. I'll...
- Bunty!

157
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:13,840
Come here.

158
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,760
She's your sister.

159
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,120
Chotta Badriya loves her.

160
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:33,640
He'll give her a home and respect.
She'll be happy.

161
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
She's already happy,
and she has a home too.

162
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,880
All you do is beat her up.

163
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
Do you like beating women?

164
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,560
Fuck all of you.

165
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:47,840
Women are goddesses!

166
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,640
No.

167
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:17,160
Why won't you let me turn you over?

168
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:23,520
If you want to experience my magic,
you can, but only on my terms.

169
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,200
Does Isa kiss men in front of everyone?

170
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,440
- That's how they greet each other.
- But he didn't say "hello."

171
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,440
That's how they say hello.

172
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
I want that car.

173
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,360
Ask me and you'll get it all.

174
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,240
What is your magic all about?

175
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,760
Never ask a magician
to reveal her secrets.

176
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,640
Sir.

177
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,280
I went to the temple.
I've brought the offerings for you.

178
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,880
How about this?

179
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
Please have some, sir.

180
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,120
Is this also the goddess' offerings?

181
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:34,760
No, sir.

182
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,560
It's an advance.

183
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:39,440
Bipin is contesting the election
in Morwad.

184
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:44,360
- Will he win?
- Yes, sir.

185
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,720
It's dominated by Marathi-speaking people.

186
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,400
There are a few from Gujarat and Marwar,
but they're all Hindus.

187
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,160
Why has he come here?

188
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:02,080
The Lalgarh area in Gopalmath.
That slum is...

189
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,880
Won't they vote for him?

190
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,000
No.

191
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,640
Sir, how will I get Muslim votes?

192
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,480
What do you want from me?

193
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,720
If the Muslims don't vote, we'll win.

194
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,640
I told you that I don't want to get into
this Hindu-Muslim shit.

195
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:38,840
Come here.

196
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,120
This is Badriya.

197
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,840
He's a Muslim.

198
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,800
We're friends.

199
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,600
That's Bunty...

200
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:55,600
a Hindu devotee.

201
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,160
We're all friends.

202
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,560
Gaston and Pascal as well.

203
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:04,120
And there's the Parsi guy.

204
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,040
He's my cook.

205
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,080
I may be a bad guy...

206
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,400
but I'm not like you.

207
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,640
So don't come back here...

208
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,040
Bipin...

209
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,280
Bhonsle.

210
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Mr. Bhonsle.

211
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:28,240
Mr. Bhonsle! Mr. Bhonsle!

212
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,080
Mr. Bhonsle.

213
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
Mr. Bhonsle, I'm Bunty.

214
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,640
I helped your father buy a piece of land.

215
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,840
I fought the union guys.

216
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,920
Took it right from under
Faruk Chand's builder's nose.

217
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,960
Deepak Shinde?

218
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:48,960
I broke Faruk Chand's hand
with a steel pipe.

219
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:53,440
You talk too much. What do you want?

220
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,720
Sir, this is your first election.

221
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:59,160
You came to Mr. Gaitonde for help.

222
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:03,240
If you win, you'll make me
one of your aides, right?

223
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,560
He doesn't give a fuck about the election.

224
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,280
Sir, he's a businessman.

225
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,080
He'll help you for the right price.

226
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,160
Mr. Bhonsle.

227
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:20,360
Asshole! Who the fuck are you
to negotiate for me?

228
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,320
Boss...

229
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,960
there won't be any issues.

230
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:27,840
You have Kukoo.

231
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,720
You have her magic.

232
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,520
- Gaitonde, hear him out.
- Shove that offer up your ass.

233
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:41,120
Boss, 50 lakh rupees.

234
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,320
Democracy is worth 50 lakh rupees.

235
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,360
Boss, that's the same price as Isa's car.

236
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,520
Who says Kukoo's magic doesn't work?

237
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,480
Rolls-Royce, baby.

238
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,280
Is it real, baby?

239
00:22:40,280 --> 00:22:42,440
<i>I hated Bhonsle,</i>

240
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:46,280
<i>but doing business with him
taught me a valuable lesson.</i>

241
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:50,680
<i>Guns, drugs, real estate,
all of those were small-time.</i>

242
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:53,480
<i>The real business was politics.</i>

243
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:22,760
<i>Even before India became a country,</i>

244
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:27,200
<i>people have been using religion
to sway political decisions.</i>

245
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:30,080
<i>When I got involved with Bhonsle,</i>

246
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,840
<i>the mafia became integral
to religion and politics.</i>

247
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,960
<i>A new era began in India.</i>

248
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,760
<i>The game wasn't between
Gaitonde and Isa anymore.</i>

249
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,880
<i>It was between the Hindus and the Muslims.</i>

250
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,240
Have faith in us.

251
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,760
I'll take care of everything.

252
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,280
Gaitonde!

253
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,360
Come out!

254
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,840
Long live India, sir.

255
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,680
I told you to give me a daily update.

256
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:03,600
Not much has happened.

257
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,200
I want Bunty.
Get him before anyone else does.

258
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:11,960
- Other agencies are also involved.
- They're not based in Mumbai.

259
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,840
You are.

260
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,920
My wife turned my phone off. Wives...

261
00:27:57,160 --> 00:28:03,280
They were emptying water from the tanks
and filling them with something else.

262
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,200
- What was it?
- I don't know.

263
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:08,800
Who was the other guy?

264
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:10,800
He didn't look Indian.

265
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:13,640
- Was he a foreigner?
- Maybe.

266
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:17,720
Bunty will be out of the country
by the 16th.

267
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,640
That's when the 25 days will end.

268
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,200
Where is Nayanika?

269
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,200
Markand, I have a lead.

270
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,720
Was it here?

271
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
Fuck!

272
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,840
Are you a man or a horse?

273
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:21,920
Bunty's gone.
Isn't he the reason we're here?

274
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:28,760
Don't you understand?

275
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,240
She'll just use you, then throw you away.

276
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,120
They call it collateral damage.

277
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,000
<i>You've created an elaborate theory
based on a local cop's word.</i>

278
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,000
Move aside, fucker.

279
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,120
The cripple has called me.

280
00:32:56,920 --> 00:33:01,480
<i>Brother, staying away
from your holy presence...</i>

281
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,680
- Did you find out about Gaston and Pascal?
- No.

282
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,200
The police came looking for you.
They've arrested two of my waiters.

283
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:33,160
I'm shitting myself here
and you're worried about your waiters.

284
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:36,640
- How will I get out of here?
- Did I tell you to get stuck in this?

285
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:49,920
You're getting old.

286
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:52,440
- Control your temper.
- Shut up.

287
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,760
- Get to the point.
- Serve the food!

288
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,320
What do you think? It doesn't make
any difference now. Understand?

289
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:23,960
I'm asking you something!

290
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:27,920
Look at me! Talk to me!

291
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:34,560
Eat, or else I'll shove it up your ass!

292
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,880
You think you're a goddess?

293
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:41,040
If you're a goddess,
then I'm a demon! A demon!

294
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,640
What are you gonna do?
You think you can hit me?

295
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,200
You cunt. Sit! Sit there!

296
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,720
Everyone is looking for me because of you!

297
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,280
I won't tolerate this anymore. Got it?

298
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,040
What are you looking at?

299
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,480
I told you to serve me food, didn't I?

300
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,400
Does this look like a show to you?

301
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,160
Call Shivaji.

302
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:30,320
Shivaji. Come here.

303
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:35,080
What's the name of that whore from RAW?

304
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,520
Anjali Mathur.

305
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:38,320
Get her number.

306
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:46,760
He called me out of the blue...
after ten years.

307
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:52,080
He asked me for a favor.

308
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,360
I do as he says.

309
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,920
Who's killing Gaitonde's men?

310
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,960
Why do you want to leave the country?
What's going to happen on the 16th?

311
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,760
Ma'am, don't you know how deals work?

312
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,400
- What's in it for me?
- What do you want?

313
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:22,760
I'll tell you everything.

314
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:25,240
Just get me out of here.

315
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,640
Out of this country. Out of India.

316
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,720
Singapore.

317
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:40,360
We'll pick you up in three hours.
You'll be taken to a safe house.

318
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,640
Don't go in there.

319
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,360
She'll die if she doesn't eat.

320
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,160
Please eat.

321
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,360
Call Sartaj Singh.

322
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:05,440
<i>There's a street next to the Nagpada
bus depot in Ambedkar Nagar.</i>

323
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,280
<i>RAW is taking him away in two hours.</i>

324
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,520
Who?

325
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,600
<i>The girl asked me to call you.</i>

326
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,640
What happened?

327
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,200
Bunty, I know where he is.

328
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,560
- Where?
- He's made a deal with RAW.

329
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:37,800
He'll be out of the country
in two and a half hours.

330
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:42,280
If we arrest him before that,
we'll have all the information.

331
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,280
I need backup.

332
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,080
Why did you come here?

333
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,520
RAW doesn't have enough people?

334
00:38:58,440 --> 00:38:59,880
Did she fuck you over?

335
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:05,280
Bunty has my informer.

336
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,840
Her life is in danger.

337
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:14,400
Then it's easy. Call for backup.

338
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,600
On one condition.

339
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,760
Junaid was armed.

340
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,920
He fired and ran.

341
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,320
I warned him to surrender.

342
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,680
He turned, pointed the gun at me...

343
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,840
and was going to pull the trigger.

344
00:39:50,120 --> 00:39:51,440
I had to shoot him.

345
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,000
<i>A man sweeps his dirt under the rug
to show the world how clean he is.</i>

346
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:19,040
<i>I invested my black market money
and launched an airline...</i>

347
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:21,040
<i>in Paritosh's name.</i>

348
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,840
What are you doing here?

349
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:47,880
- It's my airline.
- Are you trying to ruin the business?

350
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,480
Two guys from the press have already
asked me who's financed this.

351
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,080
You or Gaitonde.

352
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:56,240
Get out.

353
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:01,200
Come upstairs and we can talk.

354
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,720
If you want to be in the limelight
and pose for the cameras,

355
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,920
this deal won't work.

356
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:12,640
I'm sorry, but the work you do
will have to stop.

357
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,720
- No offense...
- No, continue.

358
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,840
Speak your mind.

359
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:38,200
<i>Do you understand what I'm saying?</i>

360
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:40,680
Make me understand.

361
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,400
That Kukoo...

362
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,600
- What about Kukoo?
- "What about Kukoo"?

363
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:47,800
Do you have any idea what she is?

364
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,120
And you're waltzing around
in public with her? She is...

365
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:56,680
Big brother...

366
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,800
think before you speak.

367
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:06,800
The whores in your fashion show
downstairs,

368
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,240
all your investors...
did you think they landed in your lap?

369
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,960
Are they here because of you?

370
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:16,560
No, Kukoo brought them.

371
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,880
She used her magic
hidden in her underwear.

372
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:23,880
There's extra space there, right?

373
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:35,680
If you love and trust her so much,
why don't you marry her?

374
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,400
Marry her, have babies,
settle down with her.

375
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,480
Don't worry about me.

376
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:50,880
I can buy happiness...

377
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:56,240
with all the money I have.

378
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:58,720
You...

379
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,560
Gaitonde, why don't you
try and understand?

380
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,520
If you want Kukoo, keep her...

381
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:09,840
but marry a decent girl.

382
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:12,920
Then keep Kukoo on the side, hidden.

383
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,400
Think about it.

384
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,160
I'll think about it.

385
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:23,600
- Hey.
- Where's Kukoo?

386
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:26,400
Where's Kukoo?

387
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,080
Boss, downstairs...

388
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,880
Kukoo.

389
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:35,040
- Kukoo.
- Go away!

390
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,920
- Kukoo.
- Go away!

391
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:40,200
- Open the door.
- Fuck off!

392
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:41,600
Kukoo, open the door!

393
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:42,920
Go away!

394
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:45,480
Just go away!

395
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:49,320
What do you want?! Tell me!

396
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,200
You want to fuck me in the ass again?
Do it!

397
00:43:52,600 --> 00:43:54,080
Don't you get it?!

398
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,720
That's not how you get pregnant!

399
00:43:57,360 --> 00:43:59,960
I can't give you children! Now go away!

400
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:02,400
Go away!

401
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,640
Do you know what I was told?

402
00:44:06,400 --> 00:44:09,440
They told me I was an asshole,
motherfucker.

403
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:10,760
A fucking asshole.

404
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:14,640
I was sent to fuck and be fucked
by all of you gangsters...

405
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,400
so you don't fuck the rest of the world.

406
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:18,760
Got it?

407
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,280
I'm done now. Go away.

408
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:24,680
Don't touch me.

409
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:28,080
- No, stay away from me.
- Don't hide.

410
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,880
- What do you want to see?
- I want to see.

411
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,520
- What will you see?
- Everything.

412
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:35,840
What do you want to see?

413
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,360
Is this what you want to see?

414
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,160
Is this what you want to see?

415
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,400
I can't have children.

416
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,360
I can't.

417
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,720
Leave.

418
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,000
Get away from me.

419
00:44:55,520 --> 00:44:59,080
I know what I'll get in the end.

420
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:02,240
- One bullet.
- No.

421
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:05,320
Either in the chest, or in the head.

422
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:12,000
Before I die, I want to have it all.
And I will have it all.

423
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:16,760
Fuck Paritosh.

424
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:20,520
I don't want your magic.

425
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:22,440
I want you.

426
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:26,800
I want your love and laughter.

427
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,600
I want... Listen, I want to see you happy.

428
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:37,720
I want to see you smile.

429
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,680
I'll take care of the rest.

430
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,600
<i>Paritosh thought I couldn't make
my money legitimately without him.</i>

431
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,080
<i>I started my own soft drink company.</i>

432
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,360
<i>It was called Apna Cola.</i>

433
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,360
<i>It was Kukoo's idea.</i>

434
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,000
<i>Apna Cola was a failure.</i>

435
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,320
<i>I threw a party to lighten the mood.</i>

436
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,760
<i>But Kukoo's mood was off.</i>

437
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:43,600
<i>She thought her charm was lost
because I saw her naked.</i>

438
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,000
<i>That something bad would happen.</i>

439
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:48,520
What's wrong with you?

440
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,080
You look worried.

441
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:58,200
You go ahead.

442
00:46:59,560 --> 00:47:00,680
Let's go and party.

443
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:06,000
Why don't you ever kiss me?

444
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,960
What do you mean?

445
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,640
You fuck me, day in and day out...

446
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,720
but you don't kiss me.

447
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:22,560
You're very tall.

448
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,360
Wait, I'll kiss you now.

449
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:26,960
- I'll bend down.
- I...

450
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,280
Wow.

451
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:38,840
You never gave a damn before,
why start now?

452
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:40,800
Let me...

453
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,040
Tell me that you won't die.

454
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:51,880
Why would I die?

455
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:58,360
Promise me that you won't.

456
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,120
I promise.

457
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:04,280
I won't die.

458
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,960
If you stay with me...

459
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:11,840
they'll kill you.

460
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,920
Everything will fall apart.

461
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:38,600
You know you'll be a big shot.

462
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:45,080
You'll become more famous
than Amitabh Bachchan.

463
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:49,920
Bachchan dies in<i> Deewaar...</i>

464
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,040
but you will shine like the sun...

465
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,080
forever.

466
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,520
All over Bombay.

467
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:02,400
Only...

468
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,800
Only if my baby is alive.

469
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,840
For Bachchan to stay alive...

470
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,960
Parveen Babi has to go.

471
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,960
You're not going anywhere. You...

472
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,360
can't go.

473
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:13,240
<i>That was the last time I saw Kukoo.</i>

474
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:18,280
Greetings from Suleiman Isa.
