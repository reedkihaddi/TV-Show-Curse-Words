00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,640
<i>Greetings from Suleiman Isa.</i>

2
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Kukoo?

3
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,040
<i>Kukoo's gone.</i>

4
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,400
<i>What do you mean, "gone"?</i>

5
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,080
Meaning fuck all. Nothing.

6
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,960
I'm Ganesh Gaitonde.

7
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,000
I don't trust anyone.

8
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,080
Even he can't harm me
because I'm above him.

9
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,960
From now on, only one god
will be worshiped in Gopalmath,

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,960
and that's me.

11
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:07,840
I'm your one true god.

12
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:49,640
- How did you find out about this?
- I had a dream. Mind your own business.

13
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,120
We have to get to him
before the RAW officers do.

14
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,840
Why are you doing this?
Is it because you like her?

15
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:04,320
Bunty won't give in easily.
There'll be gunfire.

16
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,560
Should I teach you
how to take the safety off the gun?

17
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:10,680
I'll Google it,
just like I Googled Ramakant Jadhav.

18
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,760
- Who are these people?
- They're our men.

19
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,040
Criminals turned informants.

20
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,800
If things go wrong,
we'll say we got a tip from them...

21
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,200
that they were blackmailing a builder
and got away with six lakh rupees.

22
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,960
- What's this?
- It's for your protection.

23
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,760
They fired, and we fired in response.
We don't know anything about Bunty.

24
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,000
You got it?

25
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Go, go, go.

26
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,080
What the fuck?

27
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:41,480
- This wasn't the plan.
- Just go and save the lady.

28
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:42,400
Asshole.

29
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,440
Yes, sir.

30
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,640
It's done.

31
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:05,800
Ma'am, he's found out.

32
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,720
<i>- Who?</i>
- Sartaj.

33
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,200
Where are they?

34
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,560
I don't know.

35
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,320
What the fuck?

36
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,280
Motherfucker.

37
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,200
Sir.

38
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,760
Come on, come on.

39
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,800
Stop!

40
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:05,240
You rotten fucker.
What are you doing here?

41
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,520
You started this whole game, right?

42
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,680
Why are you ruining everything?

43
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,200
Let go of Nayanika. I'll save you.

44
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,760
What will you do after saving me?

45
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,440
Throw me in jail?

46
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,920
- Let her go!
- You let her go!

47
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
Your obsession will get you in trouble.

48
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Get out of here.

49
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,960
Don't come any closer, Sartaj.

50
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,480
If you shoot,
we'll riddle you with bullets.

51
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,640
There will be nothing left of you.

52
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,560
Anjali Mathur is calling.

53
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,560
Ma'am, what the fuck is going on?

54
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,360
What is Sartaj doing?

55
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,840
Listen, let me talk to him.

56
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,440
Talk.

57
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,160
Sartaj, get out of there.

58
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,240
<i>Clear the way.</i>

59
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
You got it? Clear the way. Come on.

60
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,440
Get out.

61
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,760
Back off, Sartaj!

62
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,560
Why are you fucking with my plan?

63
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,240
Get the fuck out, or you'll die.

64
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,040
Why are you all just standing there?
Get him out of here!

65
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,360
Come on, we don't have time!

66
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,960
We're almost there.

67
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,600
Get the car, fast!

68
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,560
<i>The difficult times came without warning.</i>

69
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,120
<i>That's how things were.</i>

70
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,360
<i>This was the feeling all over the country.</i>

71
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:41,160
<i>The home minister's daughter
was kidnapped in Kashmir.</i>

72
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,600
<i>Kids in Delhi set themselves on fire
in the name of the Mandal Commission.</i>

73
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,760
<i>Prime ministers were changed
as often as underwear.</i>

74
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:53,280
<i>But I was not going to let
Gopalmath slip away so easily.</i>

75
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,760
<i>First, I banned alcohol in the gang.</i>

76
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,320
<i>This pissed everyone off.</i>

77
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,440
<i>Then I vowed to kill 50 of Isa's men
within a month.</i>

78
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:08,720
<i>Abdul in the Irani Hotel.</i>

79
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,720
How are you, bro? All well?

80
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,000
<i>Rajab Rangeela in Khajur Gully.</i>

81
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:18,800
<i>Ismail in Nagpada.</i>

82
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,920
Come on.

83
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:36,040
<i>Ajju, Vicky and Sufi in the factory.</i>

84
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,800
<i>But none of them were important.</i>

85
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,080
<i>I couldn't kill anyone
who mattered to Isa.</i>

86
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:56,400
<i>Isa went to Dubai with his family.</i>

87
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:02,160
<i>Mr. Paritosh was convinced that all this
had happened because of bad fortune.</i>

88
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Your stars... they aren't favoring you.

89
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:11,040
I mean, Saturn is interfering.

90
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,960
You know, Saturn's planetary period...

91
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,800
when its rule begins...

92
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:18,760
everything is fucked.

93
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:23,800
Mr. Paritosh told me
that this ring will fix everything.

94
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,640
Put a ring on a baby
as soon as it's born...

95
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,000
and don't worry about a thing.

96
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,560
Mess things up...

97
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,040
and this fucking ring will fix it all.

98
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,280
Hasn't this war between
you and Isa gone on for too long?

99
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,760
Isa's being fucked by us.

100
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,160
No asshole has been spared.

101
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,560
All of them are bleeding.

102
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:52,400
<i>We have also shed a lot of blood,
but you don't see it.</i>

103
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,520
Come, give your condolences.

104
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,640
In the name of God,
the merciful and compassionate.

105
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:06,840
<i>When was the last time
you spent time with your boys?</i>

106
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,200
Just hung out and had fun?

107
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:14,240
Joined Bunty at Badriya's feast
and celebrated Eid with them?

108
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,200
Got Chotta and Bada Badriya to dance
at Bunty's Ganpati festival?

109
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,920
All this used to happen in Gopalmath.
Everyone drank and had a good time.

110
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,680
It doesn't happen now.

111
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:28,760
Stop thinking with your dick,
or all you'll ever be is an asshole.

112
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,560
There's still time.

113
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,480
Save Gopalmath from getting destroyed.

114
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,720
- Think about it.
<i>- Kanta Bai was right.</i>

115
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,360
<i>After Kukoo died, I was depressed.</i>

116
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,360
<i>I tried to release my frustration in bed,</i>

117
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,560
<i>like a madman.</i>

118
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,720
<i>But whenever I saw a whore
with flowers in her hair...</i>

119
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,320
<i>I would see my mother.</i>

120
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,080
Why did you bring her?

121
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,200
<i>It wasn't just my heart,
my dick was bleeding too.</i>

122
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,680
<i>Mr. Sartaj, strength is something</i>

123
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:59,280
<i>that comes to you with all its might...</i>

124
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,320
<i>and leaves you empty when it's gone.</i>

125
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:17,680
<i>Times change rapidly, sir.</i>

126
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:23,080
<i>The leopard that made me feel alive
became the Grim Reaper.</i>

127
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,800
<i>Whenever I looked in its eyes,
I used to feel like a god.</i>

128
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,920
<i>But when I saw him in the hospital,
I felt hollow.</i>

129
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,320
<i>Empty inside.</i>

130
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,680
You were lucky this time.

131
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Did you put this on me?

132
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,080
You're alive because of this ring.

133
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,160
Since we got you to the hospital...

134
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,440
this has been on your finger.

135
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,240
I know about my death.

136
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,200
- This is not how I will die.
- Who said that you're going to die?

137
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,920
Mr. Paritosh...

138
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,520
let me speak.

139
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:18,080
Go on.

140
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,280
I want to get married.

141
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,400
To the kind of girl you told me about.

142
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,360
Look for a girl for me.

143
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,720
Careful.

144
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:50,920
Take him upstairs and let him rest.

145
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,320
Listen.

146
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:04,440
What's your name?

147
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,160
Subhadra.

148
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:08,560
You...

149
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,080
Did you put this ring on my finger?

150
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,160
To save me?

151
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,240
Can't you speak?

152
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,640
You think you're above God.

153
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:25,000
That's why he's punishing you.

154
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:36,280
So you want God to forgive me?

155
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:38,920
Speak up, bitch.

156
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,440
You don't understand.

157
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,360
You don't understand anything
beyond yourself.

158
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,720
When God punishes you, he punishes me too.

159
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,840
He makes me and my family suffer as well.

160
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,520
Are you crazy, bitch?

161
00:17:58,920 --> 00:17:59,760
Get out.

162
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:04,880
<i>Isa's ass-licker, Parulkar, gave me a tip.</i>

163
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
<i>Usman Sheikh, Isa's accountant.</i>

164
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,960
<i>He was coming from Dubai to Bombay
for his mother's treatment. Alone.</i>

165
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:17,240
<i>Until then, we had killed
Isa's small-timers.</i>

166
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,240
<i>But Usman... he mattered to Isa,</i>

167
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,480
<i>his shadow.</i>

168
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,600
He'll come here in an airplane...

169
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,040
but will leave in a coffin.

170
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,440
Coff...

171
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,920
What's a coffin?

172
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,680
A coffin is something that
when shoved up your ass,

173
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,240
will attract more tourists
than the Gateway of India. Fucker.

174
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,400
Boss, we'll build a hotel
close to his ass. Call it Ass with a View.

175
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,120
Fucker, keep your diapers on,

176
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,200
or we'll see whose bare ass
will become famous.

177
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,840
- Show me.
- Motherfucker...

178
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,480
Couldn't you find anything better
than this piece of shit?

179
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,960
I saved the good one for your funeral.

180
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:16,000
Motherfucker!
Do you want to use this to escape?

181
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,160
There's room in your ass for a coffin.

182
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,400
A slight push
and the ambulance will fit in too.

183
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,960
Sure! And you can put
the red light on your dick.

184
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,760
If I put the red light on my dick,
your sister will moan like a siren.

185
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,680
Then you'll call me a sister-fucker.

186
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,840
- Which is true in your case.
- Fucker!

187
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:56,320
- Pull the fucking trigger.
- Be patient.

188
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,360
Pull the trigger.

189
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,560
Shoot! You fucking...

190
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,560
His mom is in the way.

191
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,280
Shove the mom up your ass.

192
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,480
Motherfucker! Fucking asshole!

193
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:15,120
Move! Usman Sheikh.

194
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,640
- Hey!
- Oh, God!

195
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,000
Peace be unto you, ma'am.

196
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,520
Did you kill Usman?

197
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,840
Yes, boss. I sent him to his coffin.

198
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,320
- But, boss...
- What is with you?

199
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:47,080
Couldn't you muster the courage?

200
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,080
I don't want any problems.

201
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:58,720
You'll take your sister to the mosque...

202
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,360
and have her marry him.

203
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:03,760
Boss?

204
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,760
He gives me a watch and says,

205
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,040
"Get your sister married...

206
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:16,480
to that circumcised pig."

207
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,960
<i>I'll fuck him up.</i>

208
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,200
<i>I'll make him run like a dog for his life.</i>

209
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:27,480
<i>I'll cut him into pieces.</i>

210
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,840
<i>I'll cut him into pieces.</i>

211
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,720
Little pieces.

212
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:42,880
Hurry up! We don't have much time.

213
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,840
Hey! You dropped it! Pick it up.

214
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:51,240
- There are very few flowers here.
- Get lost! You're useless.

215
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:55,200
- Please hurry up. There's a lot to do.
- It will be done.

216
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,480
When, after the wedding? Mikki!

217
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,240
If there are four on top,
then how many will be left for the bottom?

218
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,120
That's why your father threw you out.

219
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,920
You've been thinking about the design...
And what design did you make?

220
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,360
Don't yell on such a special day.

221
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,640
- Good that you shaved today.
- Do you need more flowers?

222
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,240
- I'll get it.
- Okay.

223
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,960
- Mr. Paritosh.
<i>- Yes?</i>

224
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,160
We have to call off the wedding.

225
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,120
I don't want it.

226
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,680
Don't worry.

227
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,160
I'll walk with you.

228
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,160
It's a long walk, you'll lose your breath.

229
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,280
Your life is about to change.

230
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,240
<i>Ganesh Gaitonde is about to become Plutus.</i>

231
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:45,400
I understand.

232
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:46,640
<i>What?</i>

233
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,240
Why you're so happy.

234
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,160
You can already hear the sound of money.

235
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,320
Now shove that up your ass and come here.

236
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,920
<i>I'm sending Bunty to pick you up.</i>

237
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,160
We're ready to leave.

238
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,360
Hey!

239
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Who's there?

240
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:24,640
Come out of there!

241
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,000
You're very dear to Gaitonde, right?

242
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,280
- Who are you?
- I'm from the brothel.

243
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,640
Treat me to something sweet.

244
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:42,920
Stop bullshitting.

245
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,400
Do you think I own a sweet shop?

246
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,560
Simi told me how you like it.

247
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:53,760
She taught me how to make you happy.

248
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,360
I can take you to the moon.

249
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,280
- Where's Bunty? Bunty...
- He hasn't come yet.

250
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:05,760
I don't know.

251
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,280
Congratulations.

252
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,760
- Who is this?
- You're lucky you're still breathing.

253
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:24,200
And I'm lucky that you're still alive
to receive my gift.

254
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,920
- What gift?
- For your wedding.

255
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,400
It's on its way.

256
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:36,440
Bunty!

257
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,400
What happened?

258
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,240
- Where's Bunty?
- I don't know, boss.

259
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,040
Watch out!

260
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,520
He's driving recklessly! Pass him.

261
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:02,720
Watch out!

262
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,080
Who are these people?

263
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,880
Who are these people?

264
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,840
The girl and her family left.

265
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,280
Should I bring them back?

266
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Call the priest.

267
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,160
I will get married.

268
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,440
To whom?

269
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,760
<i>That day, I decided on three things.</i>

270
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,720
<i>Since Mr. Paritosh died for my marriage,
I'd get married that very same day.</i>

271
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:56,240
<i>I would avenge his murder.</i>

272
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,760
Boss, he's drunk.

273
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,560
You fucker...

274
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,960
Boss, what happened?

275
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,920
What happened?

276
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,800
What did I do?

277
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,600
You'll be reduced to nothing, dickhead!

278
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,000
- Boss...
- Dirty rat.

279
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,640
Boss! Please, no!

280
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:22,880
Fucker, if I see you again,
I'll make you suffer.

281
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,120
Motherfucker.

282
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,480
Boss, what did I do?

283
00:28:28,160 --> 00:28:32,000
Go to sleep.
Should I switch off the lights?

284
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,760
<i>And to beat Bunty so badly</i>

285
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,200
<i>that he'd be cursed to die like a dog.</i>

286
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:20,640
<i>Did you think for a second
before doing this?</i>

287
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,400
Did you think about the warning?

288
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:28,560
No. Did you think about
the ISI cash that you found?

289
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,920
<i>About the people of Mumbai
whose lives could be in danger?</i>

290
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:37,920
I was as concerned about all this
as you were about Nayanika.

291
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:42,840
Why do men think that they're responsible
for every woman's life?

292
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,160
<i>- When will you stop acting like saviors?</i>
- Someone has to act responsibly.

293
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,520
You belong in the field,
and I belong at a desk.

294
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,520
That's what you mean, right?

295
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,080
After the murder of Bunty Sharma,

296
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:38,480
a former member of Gaitonde's gang,
it is clear...

297
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:42,200
that this was a case of old gang rivalry.

298
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,720
Other members of Gaitonde's gang
have been killed in this manner,

299
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,560
according to our intel.

300
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,200
They will be identified soon.

301
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:58,360
The Mumbai police
have solved this case in record time.

302
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,920
I would like to congratulate
our competent officers.

303
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,000
Why is Bhonsle so worried about this case?

304
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:15,440
Sir, Gaitonde was his old friend.

305
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:23,000
The list of Gaitonde's friends
is quite long.

306
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,640
If we knew more about Trivedi,
we could get some information from him.

307
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:33,200
The mood was ruined
before the party even began.

308
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,400
We're keeping an eye on Trivedi's house.

309
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,920
I don't think anyone will go there.

310
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:42,960
- If we take a risk and...
- And?

311
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:45,840
Sir...

312
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,280
if we check Bhonsle's e-mail...

313
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,160
Hack a minister's e-mail?

314
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,960
It wouldn't be the first time, sir.

315
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,360
<i>Horses from one side.</i>

316
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,880
A helicopter from the other,
and maybe this side too.

317
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,000
There are 20 or 25 cars approaching
with the villain and his goons.

318
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,240
The cops on motorbikes from here.

319
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:12,880
You're standing here with a sword,
blood gushing from your head.

320
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:17,120
The girl is here.
As soon as the bad guy takes her away...

321
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,160
you run towards them in slow motion
and boom!

322
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,560
You know, Dad is getting us
Jackie Chan's action director.

323
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,720
Is it because you're starring
in Ranbir's movie?

324
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,920
But as far as I know... you're out of it.

325
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:23,080
I told him that you'll act in our movie.

326
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,160
Wasn't Jojo your pimp?

327
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,640
And wasn't Gaitonde your client?

328
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:35,840
I know everything.

329
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Be a nice girl... or the world
will soon know who you really are.

330
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,160
Now, go outside and thank Dad.

331
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:53,520
Thank him because you love the script.

332
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,800
Then we'll do the movie together.

333
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,560
I'll sort everything out.

334
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,000
I'll sort everything out.

335
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,560
I'll snort everything.

336
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,560
- Sir...
- Andre.

337
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:47,760
File a report.

338
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:50,320
Otherwise she'll never leave.

339
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,000
My name is Aasiya Bi.

340
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,040
My son, Shamsul,
is missing from Bengali Bura.

341
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,000
Come up for tea?

342
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:40,360
SARTAJ SINGH POLICE INSPECTOR

343
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,800
<i>There was a Parsi woman, Firoza.</i>

344
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:51,560
<i>Her German Shepherd, Lucy, went missing.</i>

345
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,800
<i>Your dad looked for her
for two days on foot.</i>

346
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,640
<i>That lady had a nephew.</i>

347
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,160
<i>He had stolen the dog to sell it off.</i>

348
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:04,040
<i>Your dad slapped him hard
and returned the dog to her.</i>

349
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,840
<i>The lady was so happy to see Lucy,</i>

350
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:13,360
<i>that she kissed your dad on the cheek
and called him a real cop!</i>

351
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,120
<i>Are you listening?</i>

352
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,960
I am.
But why are you telling me this story?

353
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:21,120
<i>I read the Granth Sahib,
but you're not religious,</i>

354
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,720
<i>so I thought I'd tell you
a different kind of story.</i>

355
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:30,240
Why do you think
I need to listen to a story?

356
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,880
<i>Dear, I'm your mother.</i>

357
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,680
TRUTH ALONE TRIUMPHS

358
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,680
<i>Inspector Sartaj Singh.</i>

359
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
Bunty Sharma was Gaitonde's
most loyal man.

360
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:12,280
He was going to give us the details
of a missing shipment.

361
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,800
<i>We got a tip, sir.</i>

362
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:22,200
<i>We've noted it in the station entry log.</i>

363
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:26,600
<i>There were two... Two terror suspects
hidden in Bengali Bura.</i>

364
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,960
<i>Why is this shipment important?</i>

365
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,120
Sir, Gaitonde warned us that something bad
was going to happen in 25 days.

366
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:39,200
We had intel that the shipment
could be connected to this.

367
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:44,200
Do you have any proof
other than Gaitonde's verbal warning?

368
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,160
<i>DCP Parulkar,</i>

369
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,960
<i>SPI Majid Khan and Constable Kamble
went to the first floor of the building.</i>

370
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,360
<i>One team was blocking the alley,
and I was blocking the building's exit.</i>

371
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,080
Sir!

372
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:10,480
What was the boy's name?

373
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,560
Sir, save me.

374
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,040
Please save me!

375
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:19,760
Junaid Sheikh, sir.

376
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,400
Did he have a weapon?

377
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,560
Save me, please!

378
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:31,760
Did he have a weapon, Inspector Singh?

379
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,240
Save me...

380
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,600
Yes, sir.

381
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:42,240
Junaid Sheikh fired at DCP Parulkar...

382
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:49,040
and was killed in the return fire.

383
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,760
Two of our decoys
and an escort were killed.

384
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,440
Bunty Sharma and his companion
were the targets.

385
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,600
In total, three of our people died.

386
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:05,480
As per the intel,
this breach was from the Mumbai police.

387
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,640
Sir, there were many rival gangs
after Bunty's life.

388
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,560
It could have been anyone.

389
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,760
