1
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,080
- Alprazolam.
- Do you have a prescription?

2
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:29,960
This is a year old, sir.

3
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:33,000
Why are you staring at me?

4
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:37,040
Do you want to lose your license?

5
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,760
You sell ice cream in a pharmacy?

6
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,280
Hey, get out of here!

7
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,400
<i>As the drought situation worsens,</i>

8
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:36,960
<i>so does the suicide rate among farmers.</i>

9
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,720
<i>There have been droughts
all over the country,</i>

10
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:43,760
<i>and Maharashtra is the most affected...</i>

11
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,400
<i>When a man is broken on the inside,</i>

12
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,640
<i>nothing can convince the world
that he still has strength.</i>

13
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,640
<i>After Isa took Kukoo away from me
and killed Paritosh,</i>

14
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,920
<i>I became impotent.</i>

15
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,000
Do it properly.

16
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,320
Bitch.

17
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,000
<i>But I couldn't stop thinking about
the mole in the gang.</i>

18
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:20,960
<i>Who told Isa that Paritosh would be
coming to the wedding alone?</i>

19
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,480
Close your eyes.

20
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:40,440
Turn around.

21
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,160
I won't be a whore.

22
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,920
You've been out drinking.
How will you be able to do it?

23
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,840
You don't know anything.

24
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,080
I know everything.

25
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,480
Ever since Mr. Paritosh died,
you've been lost.

26
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,040
Bombay is suffering and so are you.

27
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,800
Until you get your revenge,
you won't be able to do anything.

28
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,000
Katekar.

29
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:10,920
Look at this report.

30
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
- Whose is it?
- That same woman.

31
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:21,120
- Man, I've seen this.
- Check it again.

32
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,720
It's nothing.
She comes here and bothers me every day.

33
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,440
- Are you mad?
- Leave it.

34
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:30,480
You can't do this.
There's been a theft in the neighborhood.

35
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,400
- Are you aware of it?
- So?

36
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:35,000
"So"? That old woman is in the hospital.

37
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:37,920
They're looking for three boys.

38
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,800
Katekar, we'll be fucked.

39
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,760
Take a look at it.

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,080
Check it. I'll come back.

41
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,080
Give that back. There are only two left.

42
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,760
Hey, Bengali Bura's celebrity.
What are you looking at?

43
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,520
- What happened, sir?
- I'll pluck your eyes out. Motherfucker.

44
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,240
If he's not sent to jail...

45
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,200
Fuck me.

46
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,360
Sir.

47
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,080
- How long has your son been missing?
- Ten days, sir.

48
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,400
Who did he hang out with?

49
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,800
Bazil and Faraj.
They live in the neighborhood.

50
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,800
I warned him about those boys.

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,920
Look at you, Mother Teresa!

52
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,440
Your son's a saint, isn't he?

53
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,040
He's been missing for ten days, right?

54
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,240
Exactly ten days ago,
there was a theft in the neighborhood.

55
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,840
Three boys were involved in it.

56
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,880
They attacked an old couple,
robbed them and ran away.

57
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,480
Your son and his friends
have been missing since then.

58
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,880
Not my son, sir.

59
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,280
Holy shit, this place is so big.
It's a duplex!

60
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,760
Where did the money come from?

61
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,000
I'm Katekar and my house is small.

62
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,680
About half this size.

63
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,680
- He used to work, sir.
- Yeah, right.

64
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,960
He took a computer course.

65
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,880
Look at this.

66
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,640
Sure, a "computer course."

67
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:29,720
- Yes.
- Take a look, sir.

68
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,320
Let me see which course your son took.

69
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,320
Yes, sir.

70
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,560
He had to get away from here, sir.

71
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,800
From Bengali Bura.

72
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,680
- How are you here all of a sudden?
- I couldn't sleep at home.

73
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,960
- God bless you.
- I thought I could sleep here.

74
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,120
Here, have some, dear.

75
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:28,160
If Megha was still with you,
you'd be happy.

76
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,800
Home isn't something you leave behind,

77
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,040
it's what you come back to in the evening.

78
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,000
Mom, do you remember my bat?
The cricket bat?

79
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,840
That enemy of mine?
The one that I oiled every day?

80
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,640
Where did Dad get it from?

81
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,880
What do you mean?

82
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,880
It was imported.

83
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,200
Yes.

84
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,720
Dad couldn't afford such an expensive bat.

85
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,080
Are you here to pay your respects
or to investigate him?

86
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,800
Gaitonde mentioned Dad... before he died.

87
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,640
Gaitonde can say whatever he wants.

88
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
Neither of us got any sleep in this house.

89
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,720
But your dad always slept peacefully,

90
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,880
because he never did anything wrong.

91
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,640
If Jojo had the file,
we would have found it by now.

92
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,360
We've looked everywhere.

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,040
What happened?

94
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,400
What happened?

95
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,920
Oh, this? A kickboxing accident.

96
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:01,120
You expect me to believe
that's from kickboxing?

97
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,600
Tell me the truth. What happened?

98
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,360
Hey, Zoya...

99
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
What can I tell you?

100
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,040
Did he hit you?

101
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,160
So sue him.

102
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,800
That won't help.

103
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,640
He killed two people while driving drunk.

104
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,040
He got away with it.

105
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,120
What else has he done?

106
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,280
My love. My child.

107
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:05,440
Cookie.

108
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,800
He threw him off the balcony.

109
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,840
Your child?

110
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:20,920
Was he high?

111
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes, but not on alcohol.

112
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,680
What do you mean?

113
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:38,080
He'd butter his morning toast with it
if he could.

114
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:40,840
He probably does.

115
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:50,240
We'll take care of him. Don't worry.

116
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,200
Why don't you come stay with me?

117
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,600
Don't you feel lonely?

118
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:09,560
It reminds me of our home in Lahore.

119
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,960
Isn't that something you want to forget?

120
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,560
This was our first home
after the Partition.

121
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:21,120
Your father used up his savings
to build this house.

122
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,440
How can I leave it?

123
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,040
Don't worry about me, Sartaj.

124
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,600
Do your work with honesty.

125
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,440
Your heart will feel lighter.

126
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:05,480
MAJID ALI KHAN - POLICE INSPECTOR
SARTAJ SINGH - POLICE INSPECTOR

127
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,680
Fuck me, I've given you so much.

128
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
Long live India, sir.

129
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,160
We don't get to eat anything,
but at least you do.

130
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,000
Eat what you get.
A cop is telling you... eat.

131
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,560
Sir! How's your mom?

132
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,040
She was asking about you.

133
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:26,480
Come on, sir!

134
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,720
- Listen.
- Yes.

135
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,280
Yes, sir?

136
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,840
Tickets for Home Minister Bhonsle's
charity show.

137
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,200
Zoya Mirza will be performing.

138
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
Take Shalini and the kids.

139
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,160
Hello.

140
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Where?

141
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,240
The biggest player who transfers
fake currency into Asia is Shanky Purohit.

142
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,520
No one dares to mess with him.

143
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,120
Next one?

144
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,440
Shamsul! Shamsul!

145
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,760
We're both failures.

146
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,680
You didn't do your duty...

147
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,880
and I didn't do mine.

148
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,360
We curse the system...

149
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,840
say there's no place in it
for an honest officer.

150
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:12,000
There's no place for an honest man
in this city, in this country.

151
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,760
But who makes the system?

152
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,680
Who makes Mumbai? Who makes India?

153
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,880
It's us, motherfucker.

154
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,920
- Hey. Where's Deva?
- Over there.

155
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,600
Do it right.

156
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,280
Boy! Get on it.

157
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,760
Get out.

158
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,360
Quickly.

159
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,000
Have a seat.

160
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,160
Shamsul Rehman.

161
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,440
He was involved in a robbery
with two other boys in Diamond Society.

162
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,120
I've heard, sir.

163
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
His body was found in the gutter.

164
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,920
The other two boys are missing.

165
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,920
I don't know where these boys went
or where they are now.

166
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:22,680
Motherfucker, did I ask you?

167
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,520
Did I ask you?

168
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,840
The little boys who work here,

169
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:32,880
where did you buy them?

170
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,600
How old are they?
How much do you pay them?

171
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,640
I'll send you to prison
for using child laborers.

172
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,440
Did I say anything like that?

173
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,240
Fucker!

174
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,920
These boys...

175
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,680
These boys can't run a gang.

176
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:00,280
They have a boss here.

177
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,000
No!

178
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,760
Fucker! Piece of shit!

179
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:09,720
Give me some water.

180
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,280
Motherfucker.

181
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,080
Did those boys from Bengali Bura
work for you?

182
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,720
Did they, asshole? Say it, motherfucker!

183
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,320
Water...

184
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:26,680
Do you want water?

185
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:30,560
You want water?

186
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:35,000
Here, take it. Drink. Drink some water.

187
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm a Maharashtrian.

188
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:42,960
I'll break your skull open.
Say it! Say it, motherfucker!

189
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,400
Say it!

190
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,560
Listen...

191
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,360
I'll cut you up and eat you for breakfast.

192
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:54,840
Say it.

193
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,160
Dad.

194
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,560
Dad.

195
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,800
Dad.

196
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:52,240
What happened to you?

197
00:18:54,760 --> 00:18:57,560
Today, after a long time,
I behaved like a real cop.

198
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,280
Did you beat someone?

199
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,640
To get the truth out of him.

200
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
How do I look?

201
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,680
Zoya is no match for you.

202
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:14,720
Mom?

203
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:22,040
Mr. Parulkar?

204
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,600
To ease the suffering...

205
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,240
caused by the drought in Maharashtra...

206
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:35,160
the government is dispatching
more than a thousand water tankers

207
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:41,200
to the most affected areas.

208
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,120
I would like to thank...

209
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,000
the organizations that have helped

210
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,080
the government in this undertaking.

211
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:54,840
In this endeavor of ours,

212
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,360
a renowned actress
has joined hands with us,

213
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
our beloved Miss Zoya,

214
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,440
Zoya Mirza.

215
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,360
Now, without keeping
Miss Zoya from you any longer,

216
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,560
I shall say good night.

217
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,600
Long live India. Long live Maharashtra.

218
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,840
- So, Katekar...
- Yes?

219
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,160
...why did you abandon Zoya?

220
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,200
Shut up.

221
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,960
Tell me.

222
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Did you know, sir?

223
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:06,320
In his wallet, neatly tucked under
his wife's photo is a photo of Zoya Mirza.

224
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,680
Shut up.

225
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:12,440
No, sir, I'm over all that now.

226
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,000
Why are you laughing?

227
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,480
Come.

228
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,680
Surprise!

229
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:44,520
Your mom in Bengali Bura has called you
to have some dessert. Who's Faraj?

230
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,240
- Speak up.
- Who's Faraj?

231
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,960
Sir, I'm Faraj. What happened?

232
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:53,000
Your mom had a baby. Fuck me.

233
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:54,400
And you?

234
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,880
- Bazil.
- You're Faraj, you're Bazil.

235
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,360
And you? Fazil?

236
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,040
Are you old enough to drink?

237
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:05,000
Why are you asking him?
He's just grown his balls.

238
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,680
Have they dropped?

239
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:11,840
Do they have soft hair? Do you vote?

240
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,880
- Do you vote?
- No, sir.

241
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,560
You don't vote, but you drink alcohol?

242
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
Where is Shamsul?

243
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:23,760
Where is Shamsul?

244
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,960
- I don't know any Shamsul.
- No?

245
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:29,720
Shamsul?

246
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,280
You're not Shamsul.

247
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:35,360
Where is Shamsul?

248
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,360
You're not Shamshul. Did you kill him?

249
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:41,520
Speak, asshole.

250
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,720
Katekar! Call an ambulance!

251
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,640
Call an ambulance!

252
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,600
Katekar. Kat...

253
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,920
Katekar!

254
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,600
It was Isa's niece's wedding.

255
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,040
In Dubai.

256
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,960
He spent 12 crores.

257
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,440
Check out the glitz.

258
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,680
The entire film industry was there.

259
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,000
One of yours was there, too.

260
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:45,480
See?

261
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:58,800
I owe you.

262
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:12,840
Look for Bunty.
Bring him to the factory tomorrow.

263
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:35,440
Boss.

264
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,800
I picked you up off the streets.

265
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,400
I gave you everything.

266
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,080
I never treated you unfairly.

267
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:03,840
And yet you're planning to kill me.

268
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,520
- Me, boss?
- I'm not talking to you.

269
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,560
I saw your video with Isa. In Dubai.

270
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,800
You wanted him in the gang, right?

271
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,400
Did you ever wonder how many Muslims
would survive in Gopalmath

272
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,320
after he came here?

273
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,320
I think about it every day.
That's why you're alive.

274
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,760
I think about it every day
because you're like my brother.

275
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,600
But you made me the bad guy
in all of this.

276
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:49,760
What now, asshole?

277
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,840
Are you happy now?

278
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:01,320
Whatever I have done...

279
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:04,760
it's on me, okay?

280
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,280
All this shit I've done... it's on me.

281
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,240
Chotta had no idea about any of this.

282
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,520
He respects you.

283
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:18,280
Don't harm him.
He wasn't involved in this.

284
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,120
He wasn't. Don't do anything to him, okay?

285
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,680
I did all of it. I did it.

286
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,520
Please forgive Chotta.

287
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:47,880
He'll be forgiven.

288
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,160
- This time, the queen will fall.
- Tea?

289
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:19,600
- The queen will fall last.
- No? Are you sure?

290
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:22,520
You don't need anything, right? Here.

291
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,160
Take it away.

292
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,000
- You don't want any?
- Not now, the game is too interesting.

293
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Hi, boss.

294
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,440
Boss, you look stressed.

295
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,520
It's your turn now.

296
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:10,240
Bada planned Mr. Paritosh's murder
with Isa.

297
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,560
What shit are you talking about?

298
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,240
I'm not talking shit.
I'm telling you the truth.

299
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,720
You think he went to Dubai to shop?

300
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,360
He was dancing at Isa's niece's wedding.

301
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,800
He was the one who plotted
Mr. Paritosh's murder.

302
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,880
My brother planned Paritosh's murder
with Isa?

303
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,520
Am I speaking another language?
I can show you the video.

304
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:33,120
Do you want to come see it,
or should I bring it here?

305
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,680
I couldn't leave the fucking house,
thinking it was my fault.

306
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,880
- Boss, what is he saying?
- What am I saying?

307
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:40,000
- I don't believe him. He's lying.
- Ask him!

308
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,040
- Because of him I couldn't leave...
- I would never...

309
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,520
You're full of sadness.

310
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:35,960
Why?

311
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,960
If a traitor has to die, he has to die.

312
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,600
Mr. Sartaj is here.

313
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,160
What is this?

314
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,480
He left with you, didn't he?

315
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:17,280
He was walking, wasn't he?

316
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,280
What will I tell my sons?

317
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,840
He's not waking up.

318
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,600
Tell you what...

319
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,440
call him from your phone.

320
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,880
No matter how deep his sleep was...

321
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,800
he always woke up and answered your call.

322
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:53,320
Just one call, maybe he'll wake up.

323
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,080
Just one call.

324
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,200
Katekar.

325
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,400
Katekar.

326
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Love live India, sir.

327
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,120
We killed the other two right there.

328
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,400
Both the fuckers are dead.

329
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,320
SARTAJ SINGH - POLICE INSPECTOR

330
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:21,360
<i>What do they think?</i>

331
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:22,320
What?

332
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,080
If you clean the beach every day,
will it become clean?

333
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,000
Ideally, it should be, sir.

334
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,280
Where does this trash come from?

335
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,080
Clean it today...

336
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:39,320
tomorrow the sea
will bring in a thousand times more.

337
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:43,520
We stop crime every day,
go home at night...

338
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:47,040
and come back
to the same thing the next morning.

339
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
But, sir, it's clean today.

340
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:51,480
Isn't it?

341
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,080
Right?

342
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:00,280
It's a lovely place
to enjoy the breeze and have a picnic.

343
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,400
We can just lay a mat here
and relax with the family.

344
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,520
That's a lot. It's enough.

345
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,320
We'll deal with it tomorrow when it comes.

346
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:17,120
Look over there. My loving wife and sons.
Hey! Holy shit.

347
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,680
Come here!

348
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,920
Do you want a vada pav?

349
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,360
Guards, attention!

350
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:53,960
Guards, ready the guns!

351
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,480
In position!

352
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,600
Reload!

353
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,920
In position!

354
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:13,760
Empty the guns!

355
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,480
Guards, turn!

356
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:35,920
<i>Ma'am, this is Dr. Ghadge
from Kohinoor Hospital, Mumbai.</i>

357
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Yes, what is it?

358
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:42,880
<i>The full toxicology report
for the patient you admitted has arrived.</i>

359
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:49,080
<i>It was injected through the IV drip.</i>

360
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,840
I want the CCTV footage
of all the corridor entries

361
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,400
and exits from that night.

362
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:01,320
<i>Now?</i>

363
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,760
<i>All right.</i>

364
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:40,160
Holy shit, Katekar.

365
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:50,560
"I'll sort everything out."

366
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:55,720
Fucker!

367
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:57,200
