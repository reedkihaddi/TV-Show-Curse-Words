00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,680
<i>Sartaj, where are you?</i>

2
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,880
<i>Get out of there. Don't fuck around.</i>

3
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:27,480
<i>Get ahold of yourself,
or you'll end up in the small arms unit.</i>

4
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,680
<i>You can sit and clean revolvers
for a month.</i>

5
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,120
Sir, this is the same guy. Malcolm Mourad.

6
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,160
He was with the GIA in Algeria.

7
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:50,000
Then he disappeared for 12 years.
He was seen in Peshawar five years ago.

8
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,080
Germany detained him for two years
for making dirty bombs.

9
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,880
First Gaitonde,
and now Malcolm Mourad is in India.

10
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,560
Whose number do you need, sir?

11
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,680
Zoya Mirza's.

12
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
- Did you find anything?
- No.

13
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,960
Check the calls she made this afternoon.

14
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,720
She must have called Parulkar
at around 2:30 p.m.

15
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,560
Is this the one?

16
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,920
No.

17
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,800
Show me Parulkar's call records.

18
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,640
Parulkar's?

19
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,120
Yes, Parulkar's.

20
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,400
<i>The file that Jojo had is now with me.</i>

21
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:14,120
<i>It contains everything,
from Gaitonde to Pakistan.</i>

22
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,280
Tell me when you want to meet.

23
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,400
What do you want, Inspector?

24
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,320
How do you know Gaitonde?

25
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,080
He produced my first movie.

26
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:39,640
Did he pay for your surgery?

27
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:43,240
Only my acting fees.

28
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,720
When was the last time you saw him?

29
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,320
You must have made copies of this file.

30
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,160
Now you can blackmail me forever.

31
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,280
Blackmailers don't talk face-to-face.

32
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,920
When did you last see him?

33
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,360
A week before he died.

34
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,920
Where?

35
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,720
I don't know. It was dark.

36
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,320
He took me somewhere.

37
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,920
What did you talk about?

38
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,080
He asked if I had betrayed him too.

39
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,560
Betrayed how?

40
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,680
I don't know.

41
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:36,880
He was acting strange.

42
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,280
He seemed depressed,
or maybe he was scared.

43
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,960
Who was Gaitonde scared of?

44
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,760
- I don't know.
- Did he talk about an attack on Mumbai?

45
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,840
Or about a consignment
that was on the way?

46
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,000
He told me to leave Mumbai.

47
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,640
- Why?
- I just told you!

48
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,000
He was saying weird... strange things.

49
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,040
"Everyone will die except Trivedi."

50
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,120
Do you know Trivedi?

51
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,240
Have some news for you.

52
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,960
<i>Trivedi. Celibate since birth.</i>

53
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,800
<i>A bureaucrat who drank
five glasses of milk every day.</i>

54
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:05,280
<i>He dreamed of changing
the country's future.</i>

55
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,920
<i>Nobody knew much about him.</i>

56
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,840
<i>He was my third father's follower.</i>

57
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>He would touch his feet
and seek blessings.</i>

58
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,920
Bless me, Guruji.

59
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,760
It's time you stopped
with all this deference.

60
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
What can be done? Old habits die hard.

61
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,720
What time of year is it?

62
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:29,760
- It's the monsoon season...
- No, no, the date.

63
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,480
August 10th, 1992.

64
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,400
The wheel is turning.

65
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,520
Only 25 years are left.

66
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:38,800
The times will change.

67
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,080
Twenty five years?

68
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,680
- But, Guruji, I thought...
- Mr. Trivedi...

69
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:49,880
for the universe, 25 years go by
in the blink of an eye.

70
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,120
That's it.

71
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,520
Revolution will come
when we have our people

72
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
- on foreign lands too.
- Yes, Guruji.

73
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,760
Did you find anyone?

74
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,320
That's why I am here.

75
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I have someone in mind.

76
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:03,240
Sir, this is our staff.
We've reserved the hotel just for you.

77
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:05,440
This way, sir.

78
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,160
Eat.

79
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,960
Are you fasting?

80
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,960
- No.
- Then eat.

81
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,600
Why are you picking at your food?
Come on, eat.

82
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,240
Eat.

83
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,560
This is kharvas. Try it.
It's made from a cow's colostrum.

84
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,400
You can taste the sacrifice in it.

85
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:54,680
- Have some.
- Okay.

86
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:57,800
Try some for me.

87
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,000
I won't eat either.

88
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,640
Here is your bow and arrow!

89
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,280
You're not on the battlefield.

90
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,840
- Hey, Bhonsle.
- Mr. Ganesh.

91
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,320
Welcome. Please take a seat, ma'am.
Hey, get some chairs.

92
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,440
Please come.

93
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,560
Mr. Trivedi?

94
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:33,120
This is Ganesh... Ganesh Gaitonde.

95
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,800
- Ganesh!
- Mr. Ganesh.

96
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,840
Ganesh...

97
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,760
the way you radiate...

98
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,480
power and strength...

99
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:51,200
it feels like Lord Shiva has been reborn.

100
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,640
Only once in a lifetime
does God manifest himself like this.

101
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,120
I'm sure he gives you a heads-up
before coming.

102
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,000
Sir, he has a strong connection with God.

103
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,240
He's a famed scholar.

104
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:08,360
- No.
- A man of extraordinary devotion.

105
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,160
He performs holy rituals.

106
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,560
Very impressive.

107
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:14,560
- No...
- Listen, Bhonsle.

108
00:14:16,280 --> 00:14:18,600
- I have a lot to do in very little time.
- Yes.

109
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:22,480
Let's skip the small talk.

110
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,680
That's not up to you.

111
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,880
It's all predestined.

112
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,040
What do you want?

113
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,720
Your support.

114
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,800
To help our people grow.

115
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,440
To spread our wings.

116
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,720
- "Our," as in...?
- Well, our community.

117
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,800
We are just servants.

118
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,000
Bhonsle, I don't get him.

119
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,880
- You talk in riddles.
- Yes.

120
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,280
I prefer to keep things simple.

121
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,200
Okay.

122
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,840
Let's get straight to business.

123
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,400
Look, it's a big job.

124
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,120
And it's a huge responsibility.

125
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:12,400
It's time to go overseas.

126
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,920
India is going to turn into a battlefield.

127
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,480
And we need a general.

128
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,680
- Two things, Mr. Trivedi.
- Yes?

129
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,880
First, Bombay gave me all I have.
I'll never leave it.

130
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,440
And second, imagine two ducks
in front of a duck,

131
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:36,640
and two ducks behind a duck.
Tell me, how many are there in total?

132
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:37,920
Well, how many?

133
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,120
It's simple. There are three ducks.

134
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,480
If you talk in riddles,

135
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,840
I'll shove all three ducks up your ass.

136
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,240
You'll be eating and shitting
from the same hole.

137
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,680
- I'll be off now.
- Ganesh...

138
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,840
- Such a waste of time.
- Ganesh...

139
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,520
- He's an important man.
- So am I.

140
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,440
- Sir... Let her eat.
- Come on!

141
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:01,320
- Let her eat the jalebis.
- Just pack them up.

142
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,200
- Hail Lord Rama!
- Hail Lord Rama!

143
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,600
You ate so many jalebis.

144
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,200
- What?
- How many did you eat?

145
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,160
Tell me.

146
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,000
Twelve.

147
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:22,560
Gopalmath's mosquitoes
are going to get diabetes tonight.

148
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,600
Tell me something.

149
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,680
If you're so fond of sweets...

150
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,720
why didn't you eat the kharvas?

151
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,280
Well...

152
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:41,800
when I was young,

153
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,320
<i>we would get kharvas
for the Lord Ganesha festival.</i>

154
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,000
<i>I could smell it the moment
it entered the house.</i>

155
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,040
<i>We were not allowed to eat it.</i>

156
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:51,720
<i>It was only for God.</i>

157
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:57,600
But I would devour it in my dreams.

158
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,520
I'd imagine its heavenly taste.

159
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,160
It was perfect.

160
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
That's why I didn't eat it.

161
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:14,840
I thought it wouldn't live up

162
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:19,480
to the kharvas of my dreams.

163
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:22,560
<i>Trivedi asked me to leave India...</i>

164
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,600
<i>but my heart was in Bombay.</i>

165
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:29,200
<i>Yet my Bombay was about to change.</i>

166
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,520
<i>"In 25 years, everything will change."</i>

167
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,720
<i>That is what my third father said.</i>

168
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:38,040
<i>And with the fall of the Babri Mosque,
the 25-year-cycle began.</i>

169
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,960
<i>Lord Rama was born there.</i>

170
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,040
<i>That's what the priests said.</i>

171
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:46,800
<i>Babur built a mosque on it 465 years ago.</i>

172
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:49,840
<i>The plan was to demolish it
and build a temple instead.</i>

173
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:55,760
<i>The Hindu-Muslim riots began. To avenge
the demolition, Isa bombed Bombay.</i>

174
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,000
<i>The whole city turned into a graveyard.</i>

175
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,200
<i>The people of Gopalmath needed me.</i>

176
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:26,760
I don't need your money!
Go buy your men some balls instead.

177
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,080
Tell them to kill ten Muslims
for every Hindu killed!

178
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:34,760
Look! My son's legs are broken!

179
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:35,680
Look!

180
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:39,160
Look!

181
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,680
He lost his legs in the bomb blast.
What can I do?

182
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,080
I'm not God.
I can't give him his limbs back.

183
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,480
People are coming
from all over Bombay to meet you...

184
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,440
and you're sitting here in Gopalmath.

185
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:58,120
- There must be a reason...
- What reason?

186
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,560
They are all shit-scared. Cowards.

187
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,640
Only the weak need God.

188
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,600
Being weak is not a crime.

189
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,600
Religion is the biggest business
in the world.

190
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,720
They use the fear of God
to rule over people.

191
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,400
The poor don't fear God.

192
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,680
They love him.

193
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,440
He gives them strength.

194
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,000
This business that you speak of,
it's only for the rich and powerful.

195
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,440
All the poor do is struggle.

196
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:39,920
They wash people's cars,
houses and toilets.

197
00:19:41,800 --> 00:19:43,960
They're only welcomed at the temples.

198
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,840
They play loud music and dance
during the festivals,

199
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:49,520
not to please God...

200
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,200
but to enjoy their one day of freedom.

201
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,800
They're not allowed inside dance clubs,

202
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,680
so they make the city their dance floor.

203
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,000
They feel like they belong here,

204
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,000
like they're equals.

205
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,600
They feel like they're not fuckwits,
they're humans.

206
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,080
Where's Gaitonde?

207
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:04,520
Wait, wait.
Which police station are you from?

208
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,000
- Hey!
- Wait.

209
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,520
Where's Gaitonde?

210
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,000
Call him.

211
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,880
He's not here.

212
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:01,160
Cover him.

213
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,240
Motherfucker!

214
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,040
Bunty!

215
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,200
Bunty!

216
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:17,160
They weren't cops. Who were they?

217
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,680
That motherfucker Isa's men, boss!

218
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,760
Okay.

219
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,480
Both of my legs are gone, boss.

220
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,440
Subhadra.

221
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,120
Subhadra.

222
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,880
What did Lord Rama do...

223
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,120
when Ravana abducted Sita?

224
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,000
- He sent Hanuman.
- Yes.

225
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,120
He sent Hanuman, right?

226
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,680
And then Hanuman set Lanka on fire.

227
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,000
<i>Then what did Lord Rama do?</i>

228
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,000
<i>He killed Ravana.</i>

229
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,200
<i>Yes.</i>

230
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:17,520
<i>When Isa killed Subhadra,
he awoke the Hindu in me.</i>

231
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,120
<i>Isa left for Dubai after the bombings.</i>

232
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,800
<i>His business was done here,</i>

233
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,760
<i>but he took his revenge before he left.</i>

234
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,920
<i>It was my turn now.</i>

235
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:31,320
<i>Subhadra was innocent.</i>

236
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:43,000
<i>So I chose the innocent and killed them.</i>

237
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,560
<i>Isa had nothing to do with them,
but I killed them anyway.</i>

238
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,000
<i>The people of Gopalmath
had been demanding revenge</i>

239
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,080
<i>on the Muslims for a long time,</i>

240
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,640
<i>but my vengeance was only for Subhadra.</i>

241
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:22,680
All of Isa's men have been killed.

242
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,200
Abdul, Langur,
that motherfucker Ghaslet's brothers,

243
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,400
Moinuddin, Bajil, Zia, all of them.

244
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,480
Is that all, fucker?

245
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,760
Boss?

246
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,400
Burn down the entire slum.

247
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:41,240
No one should be able to escape.

248
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:48,320
Let those bastards burn in their own hell.
Motherfuckers.

249
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:49,880
Okay, boss.

250
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,800
Let's go.

251
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
Motherfuckers.

252
00:25:58,280 --> 00:26:01,160
<i>But people thought
I had avenged all of them.</i>

253
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,520
<i>By taking innocent lives,
I became their god.</i>

254
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:08,000
<i>But Subhadra was gone forever.</i>

255
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:12,240
<i>To avenge her murder,
I killed 80 Muslims in one night.</i>

256
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:16,280
<i>But she wasn't coming back.</i>

257
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,760
<i>No one had ever done this in Bombay.</i>

258
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:23,440
<i>I knew the cops would come for me.</i>

259
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,800
Please place the flowers here.

260
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:38,400
We will complete the ritual now.

261
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:41,320
Your hand...

262
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:07,800
<i>Back then, I had no idea
that Trivedi was involved in this mess.</i>

263
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:12,200
<i>But the very first time I saw his face,</i>

264
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,680
<i>I knew this man was a dog.</i>

265
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:32,280
Anything goes wrong this time
and I'm out. Did you understand?

266
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,000
Would you like anything?

267
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,560
One black tea, please.

268
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
Why did you do this?

269
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,040
Do you know the motto
of the Mumbai Police?

270
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,160
<i>Sadrakshanay Khalnigranay.</i>

271
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,080
Protect the law, destroy evil.

272
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:03,880
Nayanika...

273
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,360
She did not get justice.

274
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,280
It was my fault. My stupidity.

275
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,840
I should have told you.

276
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,920
Do you know what our motto is?

277
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,920
We protect those who protect the law.

278
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,280
So our mottos are similar.

279
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,120
What's the latest intel?

280
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:51,760
Jojo Mascarenhas used to send
Zoya Mirza to Gaitonde.

281
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,880
Gaitonde made her a movie star.

282
00:28:53,960 --> 00:28:57,720
She saw one guy
meeting Gaitonde frequently.

283
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,520
Safari suit, bureaucratic type.

284
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,840
He got Zoya's fake passport made
with just one call to the embassy.

285
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,120
Some IFS type.

286
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,080
Trivedi.

287
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,240
Did she specifically say "IFS"?

288
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,680
She said "IFS type." She wasn't sure.

289
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:19,560
- What did he talk to Gaitonde about?
- They never spoke in front of her.

290
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,960
They ran a company together.

291
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,080
Blue Global. An NGO.

292
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:25,480
It must be a shell company.

293
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,360
It's been in the news lately.

294
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,800
It sends water tankers
to drought-hit areas.

295
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:38,360
Could those be the tankers
Malcolm was emptying at the warehouse?

296
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,840
They have to be.

297
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,880
This place is filled with trash.

298
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,920
Why did you run?

299
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,800
Why is this place shut?

300
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,240
We were told that the work was done.

301
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,040
We work on a project basis.
We're done for this year.

302
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,400
What project?

303
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:47,200
Are these your company balance sheets?

304
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,080
- Yes.
- What?

305
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,520
Yes.

306
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,040
Where are the tankers?

307
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,400
They've gone to the home minister's
drought-relief program.

308
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,800
It's all official. You can't do this.

309
00:30:58,880 --> 00:30:59,960
What do the tankers carry?

310
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,320
It's not watermelon juice, obviously.

311
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,360
It's water.

312
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:12,120
- Water?
- Why are you hitting me?

313
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,840
Why don't you go check?

314
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,080
Where would we do that?

315
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,120
Where?

316
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,040
Something's fishy.

317
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,080
- What?
- The NGO is pretty old,

318
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:28,800
but there's been no funding
for the last 10-12 years.

319
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,280
Before that, the funds came
from the Czech Republic for three years,

320
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,160
from Egypt for two years,
and from Uganda for three years.

321
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:38,360
Hello? Yes, Sandeep, listen.

322
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:43,400
Make a list of all the IFS postings
from 1996 to 2006,

323
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:45,600
and see if there's a guy called Trivedi
in there.

324
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Hey, Parulkar,
what is your inspector doing?

325
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,520
<i>- What is he up to?</i>
- What happened, sir?

326
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,160
<i>I'll tell you what happened!</i>

327
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:03,360
He came to my NGO and hit the manager.

328
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,400
What was he doing there?

329
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,000
- I'll look into it.
- Get looking!

330
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:09,280
We'll parade you naked
around the city, bastard!

331
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:22,720
Sartaj, where are you?

332
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,120
I'm doing my job, sir.

333
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:28,520
I suggest you do the same.
Earn some good karma.

334
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,440
Look over there.

335
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,880
Shit. Get up!

336
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,480
- Let's go.
- Get them!

337
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:37,240
Sartaj, give me the gun!

338
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,920
- The gun! Give it to me!
- They'll kill you!

339
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,800
Move back! Move back!

340
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,320
I said, move back!

341
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,880
<i>Life has taught me one thing.</i>

342
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,120
<i>When you think you're headed to heaven...</i>

343
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,000
<i>you often end up in hell.</i>

344
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:19,160
Do you want to die, asshole?

345
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:21,400
You're not scared?

346
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:25,520
That name on your tag... Dwivedi.

347
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,880
Oh, you're finally done jerking off.

348
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:32,000
Keep your men in check. Bastard!

349
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,400
Tie him up.

350
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:36,040
Have you lost it? Think this over.

351
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,160
- Hey!
- Come on!

352
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:43,960
Mr. Parulkar,
have you been sleeping with Isa?

353
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,800
Did he bathe you...

354
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,120
spray you with perfume, and send you here?

355
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,880
<i>I'd never felt so lonely in my life.</i>

356
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:30,160
<i>But in that hell,
our fates were bound together</i>

357
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,000
<i>like iron and a magnet, Sartaj.</i>

358
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:54,080
<i>While all those bastards tortured me,
a kind man offered me water.</i>

359
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,120
<i>A messenger of God
in the kingdom of Satan.</i>

360
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:00,160
<i>Your father, Dilbagh Singh.</i>

361
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,600
Get inside or I'll shoot you.

362
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:04,800
Get inside!

363
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,560
Get inside!

364
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,480
No, ma'am...

365
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,480
Tell me.

366
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:18,120
<i>I found a guy who was in
the Czech Republic for three years,</i>

367
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,640
<i>in Egypt for two, and...</i>

368
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:21,640
- Trivedi?
- <i>No, Sharma.</i>

369
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:23,560
It's the same guy.

370
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,520
- Where is he?
- <i>In Mumbai.</i>

371
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,200
- Mumbai?
- <i>Yes.</i>

372
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:28,440
Send me the address!

373
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:29,160
