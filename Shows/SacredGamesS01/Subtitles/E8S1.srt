1
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:08,920
I informed Inspector Majid
when she went inside.

2
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,640
She never came out.

3
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,080
Only the fair-skinned man came out.

4
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,560
- How did he look like?
- He was tall and fair, with short hair.

5
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,560
I can help with his sketch.

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,040
Is this him?

7
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,840
Yes, that looks like him.

8
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,120
Where's Sartaj?

9
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,960
He didn't answer my call.

10
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,720
You're lucky.

11
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,560
Every religion says the same thing.

12
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,520
Everything is predestined.

13
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,400
The day I was born in Luxor, Egypt...

14
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,600
and you were born... in Mumbai?

15
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,800
It was decided that we'd meet here one day

16
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,280
and I would do this.

17
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,800
Endure the pain for two hours

18
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,680
and then… it will all go away.

19
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,960
What are you guys doing here?

20
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,160
Preparing for the 16th.

21
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,600
What's going to happen on the 16th?

22
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,960
Why did Gaitonde kill himself?

23
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,640
Some people are weak.

24
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,040
How did you betray him?

25
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,200
He betrayed us.

26
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,600
Aadam and Hawwa had two sons,

27
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,280
Haabil and Qaabil.

28
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,120
Allah asked them for a sacrifice.

29
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Both of them
offered their sacrifices to him,

30
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,480
but Allah only accepted Haabil's.

31
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Qaabil didn't like this
and he killed Haabil.

32
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,400
But Allah served Haabil justice.

33
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,960
Haabil, the world's first martyr.

34
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,800
And the first criminal...

35
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,520
that went to hell was Qaabil.

36
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,600
This story is in the Bible too.

37
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,440
Haabil is Abel and Qaabil is Cain.

38
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,120
We need to make sacrifices in our lives.

39
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,480
They have a message for us.
Why do we need to make sacrifices?

40
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:13,840
Why?

41
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,400
Why?

42
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,280
I don't know!

43
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,800
Allah is fed up with us.

44
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:31,720
He got sick of us when he made us.

45
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,240
We have to bear the pain for him

46
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,680
to start again

47
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,800
from the beginning.

48
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,160
That's the debt we owe him.

49
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,520
<i>We have the place surrounded.</i>

50
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,120
<i>You can't escape.</i>

51
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,520
<i>You better surrender.</i>

52
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,160
We have the place surrounded.

53
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,080
You can't escape.

54
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:53,080
You better surrender.

55
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,000
The cops are here. I'm leaving.

56
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,160
Sartaj.

57
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,040
<i>I knew from Dilbagh Singh's face</i>

58
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,080
<i>that Parulkar would kill me.</i>

59
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,160
<i>Their plan was to kill me
inside the prison.</i>

60
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:40,280
<i>With time, we get used to everything.</i>

61
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,600
<i>After being beat continuously
for 22 days, I got used to it.</i>

62
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:52,680
<i>Everyday I'd wake up, take a bath,
get beaten and go to sleep.</i>

63
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,600
<i>Just when I began to expect
that nothing would change...</i>

64
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,240
<i>I met Mathu.</i>

65
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,840
<i>My old friend...</i>

66
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,520
Mathu.

67
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,160
<i>from the Mandrax and gold-smuggling days.</i>

68
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:30,360
Easy money turns men into fools.

69
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,080
Sir, tea.

70
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,960
For you too.

71
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:37,840
I couldn't handle it.

72
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:42,240
If you'd stayed with me,
we could've destroyed them together.

73
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,920
But you're here.

74
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,720
I'm the king of Gopalmath.

75
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,560
I'm here by my own will.
They're all scared shitless of me.

76
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:59,480
Do you think I'm worthless?

77
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:04,200
Tell me if anyone gives you problems,
and I'll take care of them.

78
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,560
Isa's men... They're bastards.

79
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:14,320
Isa fled the country

80
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,520
and left them hanging here.

81
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,200
It doesn't matter.
I'll teach them a lesson.

82
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:23,640
Gaitonde.

83
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,680
They've planned to kill you in the prison.

84
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,880
They won't let you get out alive.

85
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:36,040
And you're talking about saving me?

86
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:52,920
The next one's a home run, okay?

87
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:59,600
Here it comes.

88
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:04,320
<i>Back then, I thought Parulkar
was torturing me on Isa's orders.</i>

89
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,320
<i>But I didn't know that my dear friends,
Parulkar, Bhonsle and Trivedi</i>

90
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:24,120
<i>were behind this</i>

91
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:28,240
<i>and that they were following
my third father's orders.</i>

92
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,640
Has he given up?

93
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,040
He will very soon.

94
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,440
Don't end up killing him.

95
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:43,240
Even if I chop him into pieces...

96
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,600
and throw them into the sea,
he won't be dead.

97
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,160
Bastard!

98
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,360
Like the Terminator...

99
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,720
- Fucker!
- That's how the <i>Mahabharata</i> begins.

100
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,840
What?

101
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,280
A king's semen falls into the sea.

102
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,480
- Oh!
- A fish swallows it.

103
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,520
A woman eats that fish and gets pregnant.

104
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:15,440
She gives birth to India.

105
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:19,920
A nation was born from the drops of semen.

106
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:23,760
You remind me of my father.

107
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,560
Was he a scholar?

108
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:31,360
No, but he told stories like you.

109
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,200
You guys...

110
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,880
Be careful. Your life is in danger.

111
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,200
There's not much time left.

112
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:28,000
They'll kill me in two or three days.

113
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,120
Why do you say that, boss?

114
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,440
I know what's coming.

115
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,960
I'll kill them all
if anything happens to you.

116
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,760
Get <i>Kharvas</i> for me.

117
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,760
- The white-colored one?
- I want to taste it one last time.

118
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,440
Boss, please don't say that.

119
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,160
Nothing will happen to you,
I'll get you out of here.

120
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:49,800
Stop saying all this.

121
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:52,160
- I was kidding. Listen.
- Yes?

122
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:57,080
I need a knife
to take care of a few guys here.

123
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,840
- He's a good man.
- Okay.

124
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,680
Scream, motherfucker!

125
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,080
You don't believe in God.

126
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:00,080
What's your name?

127
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,400
Jamila.

128
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:04,240
Is this your first time?

129
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,760
What did you say?

130
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,120
What language is that?

131
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,640
Farsi.

132
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,560
Where are you from?

133
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:26,800
Tell me, I'm not a cop.

134
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:32,920
Afghanistan.

135
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:38,280
We don't have much time. Just 20 minutes.

136
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:42,760
I don't have the strength in me to...

137
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,480
You don't have to do anything.

138
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:51,280
<i>I was in such bad shape</i>

139
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,880
<i>that I didn't even
have the strength to fuck.</i>

140
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,080
<i>But I felt better when I thought about
taking revenge on Isa's men.</i>

141
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,800
Isa's dog. Are you dead?

142
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,480
Come on.

143
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,640
- Wanna suck it?
- Do you have the balls to get sucked?

144
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,720
You want it, right?

145
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:37,920
<i>I swear, slitting their throats
was more fun than fucking.</i>

146
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,360
You'll get out of here when you're dead.

147
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,840
Parulkar, do you get it now?
Even in prison, I'm a god.

148
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,000
Mr. Singh?

149
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:39,560
Fucking bastards.

150
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,080
It's so dark in here.

151
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,160
Fuck, I can't see anything.

152
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,880
That's the bucket.

153
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,720
They think this will kill me. Assholes.

154
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,600
Gaitonde. Take a look.

155
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,160
This is the isolation cell.
The ceiling is low.

156
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:14,720
Shit and piss in the bucket.

157
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,360
Keep this flashlight.

158
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:19,440
Hide it in the bucket
if anyone comes to check.

159
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,120
Take it.

160
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,440
Be careful.

161
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,120
- Okay?
- Yes, sir.

162
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,320
I'll lie down here. Bastards!

163
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,480
<i>Does it still hurt?</i>

164
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:57,400
A little bit.

165
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
<i>Will it ever be normal again?</i>

166
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,800
What's normal?

167
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,560
Do you know what disabled people
call the abled?

168
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:08,440
<i>What?</i>

169
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
Anything can happen at any time.

170
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,440
Everything's temporary.

171
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,880
Everything.

172
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,120
<i>Sartaj?</i>

173
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,320
Please visit soon.

174
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:39,120
How are you?

175
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,880
The fever's gone.

176
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:51,480
We're interrogating Bhonsle tomorrow.

177
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:53,680
Did he agree?

178
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:58,080
He can't avoid it,
especially now, after Anjali's death.

179
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,560
Any lead on Malcolm?

180
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,120
But his fingerprints match with those
found at Trivedi's house.

181
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,560
It's almost certain that Anjali was...

182
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,680
He can't get away.
All the exit points are on alert.

183
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,480
I wonder why would anyone
kill a RAW agent.

184
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:23,480
It's a huge risk.

185
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:25,960
Sartaj, we'll find out.

186
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,760
Your NGO was transporting
Gaitonde's weapons to India

187
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,520
in those water tankers.

188
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:16,360
- What do you have to say about this?
- Nothing.

189
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,120
<i>We're collecting evidence
from offshore accounts.</i>

190
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:21,640
<i>Go ahead.</i>

191
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,320
What do you know about Trivedi?

192
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,600
Nothing.

193
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:30,920
Bunty delivered those weapons to Malcolm.

194
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,520
Who allowed him to use
a private freight line?

195
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,160
Tell us or we'll have to file
a police report.

196
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,120
Try doing that.

197
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:43,240
Don't hold yourself back, sir.

198
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:48,040
Do it for yourself,
if not for the country. It'll do you good.

199
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,600
So, you don't know Trivedi?

200
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,600
I do not.

201
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,240
Trivedi emailed you this picture.

202
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,720
Try to remember.

203
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,440
We know there are more emails.

204
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,320
Do your worst.

205
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:23,800
You people will not understand.

206
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:25,600
What are you talking about, sir?

207
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,320
Aren't you ashamed of betraying
your country...

208
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,920
Shut up!

209
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,920
- You can't see it.
- What can't we see?

210
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,640
You can't see
that this country's in danger.

211
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,200
You can't.

212
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,280
Maybe you aren't aware

213
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:45,000
that we're the most peace-loving country
in history.

214
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:50,840
We've never been the first to attack...
and this time is the same.

215
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,400
But if we're attacked...

216
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:59,080
we must be ready.

217
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,280
What attack?

218
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,520
The country's in danger.
We can't just sit and wait.

219
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,560
What danger?

220
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:09,560
You're such a smart group of guys,

221
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,960
figure it out yourselves.

222
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,120
<i>Dilbagh Singh introduced me
to my third father.</i>

223
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,720
<i>I called you to repay his debt.</i>

224
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,040
<i>Everything will be destroyed in 25 days.</i>

225
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,880
Why are you... Bastard.

226
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,440
You son of a bitch.

227
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,400
Let go.

228
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:03,400
Dirty bastard!

229
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:57,000
Give me some water, Parulkar.

230
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,240
Water, please.

231
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,600
Mr. Singh.

232
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,120
Please get me some water,
I'm dying of thirst.

233
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,320
Will you really kill me, fuckers?

234
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,640
Water, piss...

235
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,880
just give me anything to drink, Mr. Singh.

236
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:30,040
<i>Parulkar was a bastard.</i>

237
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:37,680
<i>I could barely speak, or I'd have told him
to shoot me and end it all.</i>

238
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:42,920
<i>I survived for about 25 days
without food or water.</i>

239
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,320
<i>I had no strength left.</i>

240
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,560
<i>Every day seemed like my last.</i>

241
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:04,120
Three days ago, your news was published
in all the papers.

242
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:07,720
By now, they're probably in the garbage.

243
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,160
The cows will eat them up.

244
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:16,000
Stop it. Your dad would've been so happy.

245
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:18,800
I dreamt of him the day before yesterday.

246
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,400
He wouldn't have.

247
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,680
What?

248
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,320
He wouldn't have been happy.

249
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,400
Why do you say that?

250
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,760
He surely had something
to do with Gaitonde,

251
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,200
for him to send us the cricket bat.

252
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:37,680
I told you,
his conscience was always clear.

253
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:40,040
Then why did Gaitonde call me?

254
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:42,880
Why would a famous gangster

255
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,800
remember an ordinary officer
after 25 years?

256
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,800
Because everyone remembers a good man.

257
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,360
Your father wasn't ordinary.

258
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,640
<i>I didn't mean that.</i>

259
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,600
Then what did you mean?

260
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:07,520
That he sold his integrity for this bat?

261
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,080
Then what's the truth, Mom?

262
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,600
The truth is that

263
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:16,600
when your father was at work,

264
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,800
he often gave Gaitonde his food.

265
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:19,840
Hold on.

266
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:24,200
Did he work at the prison
where Gaitonde was being held?

267
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,280
There's no record of it.

268
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:32,320
Yes. It was an unofficial posting
for two months

269
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,120
under Parulkar.

270
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:37,640
They'd beat him black and blue
in the prison.

271
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,880
Gave him no food or water.

272
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,440
He was kept in the isolation cell
for 15 days at a time.

273
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,400
Everyone thought he'd die.

274
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,800
Your dad couldn't bear to see this.

275
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,920
So he'd tell me to make extra rotis.

276
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:58,760
Ganesh.

277
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,000
Ganesh.

278
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,640
Eat this.

279
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:16,000
Your father saw Gaitonde
as just another human being

280
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,440
and so he helped him.

281
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:20,720
A while later,
Gaitonde called and thanked us

282
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,600
and said, "Ask for anything you want."

283
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,560
But he took nothing.

284
00:34:29,160 --> 00:34:31,080
One day, he casually mentioned

285
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,600
that you wanted to be a cricketer.

286
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,680
So Gaitonde sent us this bat.

287
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,040
Someone wants to talk to you.

288
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,840
Ganesh, hurry up. Someone will come.

289
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,280
Come on, be strong.

290
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:58,240
<i>Close your eyes...</i>

291
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,440
<i>and chant...</i>

292
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:07,840
<i>"I am Lord Brahma."</i>

293
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,080
<i>"I am the Alpha and Omega."</i>

294
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:17,560
Close your eyes and chant,
"I am Lord Brahma."

295
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,840
"I am the alpha and omega."

296
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>Gaitonde,</i>

297
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:22,960
<i>it's Trivedi.</i>

298
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,960
<i>I know your condition.</i>

299
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:29,760
<i>Guruji wants to have a word with you.</i>

300
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,400
<i>Gaitonde, you'll live.</i>

301
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:38,680
<i>You may feel that you're going to die,</i>

302
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,480
<i>but you will not.</i>

303
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:46,840
<i>We all carry the burden of our fathers.</i>

304
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:52,040
<i>In the west, the son envies the father.</i>

305
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,480
<i>Freud called this the Oedipus Complex.</i>

306
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,120
<i>Deep inside,
every son wants to kill his father.</i>

307
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:09,880
<i>But we believe in Yayati.</i>

308
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,520
<i>In contrast to the West...</i>

309
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:18,600
<i>the father envies the son.</i>

310
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,040
<i>The father wants to sacrifice the son.</i>

311
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:30,640
<i>And eventually, he must do it.</i>

312
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:35,520
<i>This is the blessing and the curse
of being a father.</i>

313
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,160
Gaitonde's third father.

314
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,640
Who are you?

315
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,520
<i>A friend, a brother, an enemy...</i>

316
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:47,680
<i>a father, a son or a lover,
whatever you want me to be.</i>

317
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,200
What do you want?

318
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:54,120
<i>I want you to believe that you'll live.</i>

319
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,360
Bullshit. They'll kill me.

320
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:05,640
<i>Relax.
Think about the first time you felt fear.</i>

321
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,720
<i>Look at the wall in front of you.</i>

322
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:39,640
I killed her.

323
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:44,240
I killed my mother... with my own hands.

324
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,440
I've sinned.

325
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,680
I'm not going to survive.

326
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,400
I'm going to rot and die here.

327
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,360
<i>You're both the mandala
and the door to it.</i>

328
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,240
<i>You'll survive.</i>

329
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,840
<i>You must survive.</i>

330
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,120
<i>Understand the mandala
and you'll be free of the curse.</i>

331
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>It represents the universe.</i>

332
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,480
<i>A powerful device.</i>

333
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:39,160
<i>Like every word is a mantra,
every symbol is a key.</i>

334
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:43,440
<i>From ancient to modern times,</i>

335
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:47,080
<i>you will find symbols all around us.</i>

336
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:51,240
<i>They should only be placed</i>

337
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,680
<i>at the doorway...</i>

338
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,400
<i>or in the passage.</i>

339
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,520
Gaitonde.

340
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:34,440
You rat.

341
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,520
Come out.

342
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,000
Come on.

343
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,000
Come.

344
00:39:56,600 --> 00:39:57,760
I won't die.

345
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,080
What?

346
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:04,880
I'm... not going to die.

347
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:03,120
<i>I came out to find</i>

348
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,960
<i>Isa's men waiting for me.</i>

349
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:17,640
<i>Mathu and I</i>

350
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,440
<i>against 40 of them.</i>

351
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,520
RAKSHAK PARTY

352
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,640
<i>It was certain that I'd die,</i>

353
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:43,160
<i>but that voice kept my hope alive.</i>

354
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,120
<i>It said, "You'll live, Gaitonde."</i>

355
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:48,480
<i>But I needed a miracle...</i>

356
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:49,880
<i>and it happened.</i>

357
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:54,440
<i>Men dressed in black
came and took me away.</i>

358
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,440
<i>I was half-conscious,</i>

359
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:01,200
<i>but I was dying to meet the one</i>

360
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:06,280
<i>who saved my life and changed my fate.</i>

361
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,680
<i>That man was my third father.</i>

362
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,120
<i>A mastermind.</i>

363
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,400
<i>He played a game with me in the prison</i>

364
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:18,960
<i>and now, he's playing
the 25-day game with Mumbai.</i>

365
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:21,000
He told me to leave Mumbai.

366
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,160
Twenty-five days is all you have
to save Mumbai.

367
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,880
Gaitonde told the cop
about the 25-day matter.

368
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:27,720
The country's in danger.

369
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,240
Everyone will die, except Trivedi.

370
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,200
Mr. Sartaj, my information is never wrong.

371
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:48,920
Holy shit.

372
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:50,840
