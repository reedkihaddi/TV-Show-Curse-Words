1
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,439
Leave it! You sister-fucker!

2
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:57,120
Leave it! Leave it!

3
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,840
I didn't know where I was.

4
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,360
Who brought me here? don't know.

5
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,480
Why they brought me here? I don't know.

6
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,600
Life was like hell to me, Sardar Ji.

7
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,880
Just like yours, will be.

8
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,600
Sister-fucker!

9
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,160
Jai Hind, Sir!

10
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,040
Bibinka623 has been activated.

11
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:25,520
They don't want...

12
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,939
The biggest billionaire. He's
finally decided to go to Montreal

13
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,060
to save 400 millions in tax, you see.

14
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,320
Sir, Bibinka623 has been activated.

15
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,120
Fuck!

16
00:03:13,095 --> 00:03:16,279
When I got out from
that dark cellar after 40 days,

17
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,640
there was only one thing in my mind.

18
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:22,294
I just have to fuck them all!

19
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:24,479
Whoever had done this to me...

20
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,200
Isa, Parulkar, everyone!

21
00:03:32,575 --> 00:03:35,679
Then I realized that this
game is much bigger than

22
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,000
these bastards...
bigger than you... bigger than me.

23
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,744
My information
is never wrong, Sardar Ji.

24
00:04:07,745 --> 00:04:10,705
I told you that Trivedi would survive.

25
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,040
Swear, I told you the truth.

26
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,360
Try to solve this riddle...

27
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,960
you would get all the answers.

28
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,999
Sir, we got this
pamphlet from the bunker

29
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,280
it looks like a recruitment
poster of a terrorist outfit.

30
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,799
Generally they propagate such materials,

31
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,720
usually before any big attack.

32
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:24,199
And it says this is time of war, now.

33
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,600
ISIS has been trying to breach in India,

34
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:29,709
- this maybe any splinter group
- No.

35
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:32,933
We have been keeping a close
watch on ISIS, at the state level.

36
00:05:32,934 --> 00:05:34,597
There's nothing alarming there.

37
00:05:34,598 --> 00:05:36,778
Our agent... Anjali Mathur...

38
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,839
She was studying Hizbuddin.

39
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,359
We got a tip-off from Baluchistan...

40
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,199
Mario, - Sir.

41
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:45,240
... set up an SIT for this.

42
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:48,280
Lashkar, ISIS, and Hizbuddin...

43
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:51,800
- For the time being let's go after them.
- Sure, sir.

44
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,120
Sartaj... good work.

45
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,740
Will you join the SIT?

46
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,120
Yes, sir.

47
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,560
Sir...

48
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,800
... SPI Majid Khan
is specialist on terror cells.

49
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,760
Sure.

50
00:06:07,462 --> 00:06:10,742
Majid, Sartaj will take
the lead on this case..

51
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,280
Yes, sir.

52
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:16,600
Now, you're the boss.

53
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,879
Give me a treat, man.

54
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,607
That big arms consignment

55
00:06:20,608 --> 00:06:22,464
has a direct link to Bhonsle's NGO...

56
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,519
How does Hizbuddin fit into this?

57
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,834
Couldn't Bhonsle be
working for someone else?

58
00:06:28,835 --> 00:06:29,919
You think so?

59
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,055
You don't get involved in big cases,

60
00:06:32,056 --> 00:06:34,159
so, you won't know the
reality of Shahid Khan.

61
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,199
He has his hand in everything,

62
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,079
from the 93 blasts in Mumbai
to the Kandahar Hijacking.

63
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,200
We must check.

64
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,840
You find Shahid Khan.

65
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,360
I'll look for Gaitonde's third father.

66
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,000
It's alright!

67
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,480
Its over! Its over!

68
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:21,439
What's going to happen in 25 days?

69
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,479
My father will fuck you all,

70
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,879
but I'll save Trivedi.

71
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,040
Which father?

72
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,159
That priest in village?

73
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,120
No, Sir. I've three fathers.

74
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,200
Three reasons why I'm here.

75
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,677
The first one put fear in me,

76
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:37,559
the second gave me the
courage to face it.

77
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,280
And the third one who
I loved most, betrayed me.

78
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:46,760
It is possible to conquer time....

79
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:51,000
Because time is radioactive.

80
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,840
It decays and it stays... forever.

81
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,520
it is a circle.

82
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:04,639
And this circle of time is divided into

83
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,999
four Eras.

84
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,560
Four Yug.

85
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:29,625
Megha?

86
00:08:33,293 --> 00:08:34,293
Megha!

87
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,520
Yes?

88
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,880
Can we try it again?

89
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,920
You speaking rubbish.

90
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:02,840
I'm damn serious.

91
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,440
Serious?

92
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,800
Alright.

93
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,280
Let's talk seriously.

94
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:23,920
Why now?

95
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,840
Because...

96
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,240
I can't do this anymore.

97
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:42,120
One by one...

98
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,160
I'm loosing everyone from my life.

99
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,720
I'm feeling lonely.

100
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,280
Now, I'm scared that...

101
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,960
You'll leave me as well.

102
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,560
I'm already gone, Sartaj.

103
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,160
No, Megha, please...

104
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,760
Please, don't say this.

105
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,120
We'll only fight.

106
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
No.

107
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,320
It's too late now.

108
00:10:29,935 --> 00:10:32,079
You don't understand Sardar ji,

109
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,024
where the story is heading?

110
00:10:34,025 --> 00:10:35,865
I didn't get it as well.

111
00:10:37,135 --> 00:10:39,119
Life was weird in there.

112
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,800
I mangled one of the guards,

113
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:45,920
but even then he didn't tell
me a word about our location.

114
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,760
Well, what would
he say now that he's dead.

115
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,439
The raging fire of
revenge burned within me

116
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,960
while I tried swimming in
freezing waters, towards Mumbai.

117
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:02,080
Everyday I were swimming
gradually more than previous day.

118
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,480
Slowly approaching towards Mumbai.

119
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:09,279
There was nothing to do on the boat.

120
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,464
Swim daily,

121
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:11,928
eat shitty fish,

122
00:11:11,929 --> 00:11:14,112
and jerk off thinking about Gopalmath.

123
00:11:14,113 --> 00:11:15,753
That was the life.

124
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:19,800
Then one day, in the distance,

125
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,960
that answer was coming to me.

126
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,080
Hold this.

127
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:45,544
Wait sir.

128
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,130
This is your bag.

129
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,400
Let me speak first.

130
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,240
Anything else?

131
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,120
Ma'am you don't know him.

132
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,200
He's a crazy guy.

133
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,320
A man has died trying to control him

134
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,200
Where is he?

135
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,200
He was there, just sleeping.

136
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,999
Did anyone come in the room?

137
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,080
- I don't know.
- Ganesh! Ganesh!

138
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:34,280
Motherfucker, I'll shove
those keys up your asshole.

139
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,840
Come here, and take this key.

140
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,440
Shove'em up whoever's ass you want.

141
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:43,159
What's this Gaitonde?

142
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:45,820
- We were coming to talk to you.
- Shut up, you asshole!

143
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,440
I want to go back to Mumbai.

144
00:12:52,295 --> 00:12:53,359
Gopalmath!

145
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:56,440
You can't go to Mumbai, yet, dear.

146
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,879
Who are you?

147
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,880
A friend.

148
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,600
What do you want? Just tell me.

149
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,880
You have just locked me
here like a fucking cattle.

150
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:16,534
There's a country
in Africa called Kenya.

151
00:13:16,535 --> 00:13:18,199
There's a city called Mombasa.

152
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,880
It's not far from there.

153
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:25,385
I heard you tried
swimming back to Mumbai?

154
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,840
If you want to swim

155
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,344
then it'll only take you
188 years to reach there.

156
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,745
I've calculated it.

157
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:38,279
If you can read Marathi, then read it.

158
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,959
While I was stuck
jerking off in her memory.

159
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,664
DIPAK SHINDE ALIAS
BUNTY JAILED FOR 2 YEARS

160
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:43,888
Mumbai...

161
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:45,809
Mumbai was forgetting me.

162
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,024
Trivedi's men
demolished the Babri Mosque.

163
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:52,609
Isa planted bombs in the
city, with ISI's agent Shahid Khan.

164
00:13:53,714 --> 00:13:56,897
Police did tit for tat.
They wanted every gang out.

165
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,200
Grab him.

166
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,120
Hey! Hey! Hey... you government
officers. Show some respect!

167
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:30,544
Come out!

168
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:32,888
Leave me! I'm coming with you.

169
00:14:32,889 --> 00:14:36,193
Isa and me vanished;
Mumbai's balance was disturbed.

170
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:38,738
All the mafia business was wrecked up.

171
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,679
And Gopalmath became wasteland.

172
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,159
How can I run?

173
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:45,344
The country got divided in 1947

174
00:14:45,345 --> 00:14:47,719
Mumbai was minced in 1993.

175
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,599
Some took over the city.

176
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,040
and some were forced into ghettos.

177
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:55,424
My Mumbai was dying.

178
00:14:55,425 --> 00:14:56,425
Name?

179
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:58,640
Kusum Devi Yadav.

180
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,439
What do you want?

181
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,280
Work for us, here in Kenya.

182
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,400
I don't work for anyone.

183
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,360
We're offering partnership.

184
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,920
Start your business here

185
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,640
and later I'll get your
guys free from the jail

186
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
You want to revenge from Isa, right?

187
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,520
I can help in it.

188
00:15:19,215 --> 00:15:21,279
Who are you actually?

189
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,200
I have friends in Mumbai.

190
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:24,920
And here?

191
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,640
Here as well.

192
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:30,640
Partnership?

193
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,560
Who was over the phone?

194
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,519
What phone?

195
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:48,640
That one whom I spoke with in jail.

196
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:50,400
In Jail?

197
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,624
Don't fuck with me asshole.

198
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,145
You brought me here. You
know who I'm referring.

199
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,504
Yes, yes. Guru Ji! Guru Ji.

200
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,000
His preachment.

201
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,720
And yes...

202
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:19,640
Push the button if you like.

203
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:22,720
That will be our signal.

204
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,320
The first incarnation of Lord Vishnu,

205
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,144
is "Matsya".

206
00:16:32,145 --> 00:16:33,145
A fish.

207
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,162
is directly connected

208
00:16:36,163 --> 00:16:38,504
to the very beginning of
the life on the earth.

209
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:43,160
We, humans, also evolved from the fish.

210
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,840
One day, the almighty God,

211
00:16:47,760 --> 00:16:51,280
was so aroused after seeing
own creation, and got ejaculated.

212
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,800
His semen directly dropped into the sea.

213
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,644
In the sea,

214
00:16:58,645 --> 00:17:00,365
a fish swallowed it.

215
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,839
The semen was so potent

216
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:06,159
that the fish

217
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,200
started suffocating after swallowing it.

218
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:11,760
Here, done.

219
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:15,557
Whether Aryans or fighters

220
00:17:15,558 --> 00:17:17,661
or a shreded arrow.

221
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:19,086
I want chicken.

222
00:17:19,087 --> 00:17:22,727
Whether scholars or keen
or the sages of the high mountains.

223
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,279
Brought me fish next time I'll
shove it in your ass, you fucker,

224
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,264
And it'll keep swimming in there
until we fucking reach Mumbai.

225
00:17:30,265 --> 00:17:33,705
It only exists then.

226
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:42,744
That time I thought it was all bullshit.

227
00:17:42,745 --> 00:17:46,488
Later, I realized that
Guruji was telling me my own story.

228
00:17:46,489 --> 00:17:48,633
I was the fish of that story.

229
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,094
I was suffocating as well.

230
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,399
I made my efforts.

231
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,987
I had decided that

232
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:58,184
I have to get off this
boat, first of all.

233
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,559
Jai hind, Sir. First floor upstairs.

234
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:36,280
The first room is yours
I'll bring your stuff.

235
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,504
This is Katekar's package.

236
00:18:47,505 --> 00:18:49,025
From L.T. Marg.

237
00:18:58,800 --> 00:18:59,800
Kamble.

238
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,640
Yes, Sir?

239
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:06,640
Has Katekar's compensation
letter arrived.

240
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,200
No, Sir. I won't come that soon.

241
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,504
Sir, please make a call
to Shalini and tell her

242
00:19:12,505 --> 00:19:16,265
if any letter is received at home,
she has to sign and send back here.

243
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,440
Get ready.

244
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,662
Hey, listen.

245
00:19:33,663 --> 00:19:35,959
Wait a minute. I'll get the lunchbox.

246
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,239
- Don't worry.
- Hey.

247
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:46,559
Easy!

248
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,144
I'm trying.

249
00:19:49,145 --> 00:19:51,385
Your father did this.

250
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Where could this pamphlet be printed?

251
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,240
I don't know.

252
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,396
Majid, We have to do our duty.

253
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,840
So, you do yours.

254
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,320
First go to Sulphur
Road, then Neel Ghaati.

255
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,680
Hey!

256
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,640
Malcolm, come on, I'm also leaving here.

257
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:35,200
Take me with you.

258
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,704
I'm fucked up
with your tactics. Let's go.

259
00:21:39,705 --> 00:21:41,009
You must stay underground

260
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,774
I won't say anything to
anyone. You motherfucker.

261
00:21:43,775 --> 00:21:46,058
- Let me go!
- There's no way to say a word.

262
00:21:46,059 --> 00:21:49,163
Hey, Malcolm! Don't try
to act smart with me.

263
00:21:49,164 --> 00:21:51,888
Malcolm, give me my phone.

264
00:21:51,889 --> 00:21:53,553
Motherfucker!

265
00:21:53,554 --> 00:21:56,098
You're hitting me?

266
00:21:56,099 --> 00:22:00,859
Malcolm! You motherfucker! Motherfucker!

267
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,880
Hey! Leave me!

268
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:07,520
Leave me!

269
00:22:11,945 --> 00:22:13,625
Hey, Malcolm.

270
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,160
Hey, you sister-fucker.

271
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,680
Gaitonde left something with you.

272
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,944
Tell me, where have you hidden it?

273
00:23:02,945 --> 00:23:07,745
What? I don't have anything.
I don't know what you want.

274
00:23:09,668 --> 00:23:11,708
Please, I don't know.

275
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:14,384
I don't have what you want.

276
00:23:14,385 --> 00:23:15,585
Please...

277
00:23:17,386 --> 00:23:18,969
I don't know what you want.

278
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:20,034
I don't know...

279
00:23:20,035 --> 00:23:21,875
I don't know what you want.

280
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,904
I don't have anything.

281
00:23:23,905 --> 00:23:26,509
- You've last chance...
- I don't have anything.

282
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:27,534
I...

283
00:23:27,535 --> 00:23:29,535
- Tell me.
- I don't have...

284
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,985
What else did he say about Trivedi?

285
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,240
As much as I told you.

286
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:10,439
Did he ever mention about Malcolm?

287
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,360
- Inspector, I'm done here.
- Anything about an Egyptian man?

288
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,840
If you call me one more time,
I'll sue you for harassment.

289
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:42,480
Then the fish crawled
back from sea to land.

290
00:24:43,066 --> 00:24:44,919
But, just like a crocodile does

291
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,330
it was still important to stay near sea.

292
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:25,960
- Hello, who's this?
- Whats up, ass-wipe?

293
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Gaitonde boss?

294
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,944
Boss, where are you?

295
00:25:29,945 --> 00:25:31,945
I'm 188 years far from you.

296
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:33,784
You are out?

297
00:25:33,785 --> 00:25:34,785
Yes, boss.

298
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:36,920
They hit me very hard.

299
00:25:37,836 --> 00:25:39,820
Then suddenly released me last week.

300
00:25:39,821 --> 00:25:41,085
Kanta Bai is also out.

301
00:25:41,086 --> 00:25:43,949
Don't know why they caught
us and why they released us.

302
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:46,150
I'm worried perhaps they can shoot us.

303
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,994
Boss, our business is dead.

304
00:25:48,995 --> 00:25:50,458
I know it.

305
00:25:50,459 --> 00:25:52,523
I'm just taking biscuits with black tea.

306
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:54,387
I'll take care of it.

307
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:58,852
Boss, you are 188 years away or 188 km?

308
00:25:58,853 --> 00:26:00,617
I'm on the moon, you moron.

309
00:26:00,618 --> 00:26:03,442
It'll take some time
to come back to Mumbai.

310
00:26:03,443 --> 00:26:05,427
What are you doing there, boss?

311
00:26:05,428 --> 00:26:08,511
Things are going to normalise
here, please try to come soon, boss.

312
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,672
- It'll take some time.
- How much time boss?

313
00:26:11,149 --> 00:26:12,412
One month.

314
00:26:12,413 --> 00:26:13,413
One month?

315
00:26:14,255 --> 00:26:16,399
But moon is right here, over our heads.

316
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,184
It'll take whatever time
it takes, you dickhead.

317
00:26:19,185 --> 00:26:22,585
If I piss here then it'll take
one month to fall on your head.

318
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,720
Look, this is "their" Juhu beach.

319
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,184
Go and drown in it.

320
00:26:28,185 --> 00:26:31,409
Bunty, listen. They got me stuck here.

321
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,650
But I'll get out from
here whatever it costs.

322
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,239
You can run Gopalmath if you want.

323
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,680
I want the whole
gang reunited here. Okay?

324
00:26:40,855 --> 00:26:41,879
Okay, boss.

325
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:43,919
- Okay, now hang up.
- Boss! Boss!

326
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,039
Yes?

327
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,304
Kanta Bai is right
here. Just talk to her once.

328
00:26:48,305 --> 00:26:49,745
She really loves you.

329
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,744
Okay, I'll kiss her when I see her.

330
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:53,745
Boss!

331
00:26:58,295 --> 00:26:59,719
Fuck!

332
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:02,640
We're playing carrom here
and Boss has reached the moon.

333
00:27:08,065 --> 00:27:09,529
This is called fate.

334
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:10,530
Pick it up.

335
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,160
Haste is foolish, Ganesh.

336
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,240
Miss Yadav is very sharp.

337
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,400
It's not easy to go away from her.

338
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:24,800
Who's she?

339
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,840
She's a RAW operative.

340
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,080
You asshole, why you brought her to me?

341
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,840
Because, we're more sharp than her.

342
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,160
Fuck this sharpness.

343
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,440
Let her think that
your balls are in her court.

344
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,839
When the time is right make your shot.

345
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:46,680
Don't give me a lollipop.

346
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,270
No, Miss Yadav's friendship

347
00:27:50,271 --> 00:27:52,239
is a protein shake
rather than a lollipop.

348
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,104
It will take you to Isa.

349
00:27:54,105 --> 00:27:56,049
I don't like protein shake.

350
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,770
The control is in her hands.

351
00:27:58,887 --> 00:28:00,727
You life, your freedom

352
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
is a collar she's tied around your neck,

353
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,240
That you can't remove from your neck.

354
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,960
Till when?

355
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:14,120
Until Guru Ji can
find a way out of this.

356
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,920
Look here, it's your new house.

357
00:28:23,278 --> 00:28:24,381
Come in.

358
00:28:24,382 --> 00:28:27,222
Trivedi insisted so I took the job.

359
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,251
I came to know,

360
00:28:29,252 --> 00:28:31,828
that same fucking shit is
going on outside india.

361
00:28:31,829 --> 00:28:35,133
When the USSR invaded Afghanistan,

362
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:37,814
then USA and Pakistan used an old trick.

363
00:28:38,649 --> 00:28:40,593
They pushed local militants.

364
00:28:40,594 --> 00:28:42,591
They backed them for blasts

365
00:28:42,592 --> 00:28:45,082
and suggested to cartel for money.

366
00:28:45,083 --> 00:28:48,663
Militants would smoke
some and sell the rest to Europe.

367
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,962
USSR got defeated
there but business stayed.

368
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:56,239
Before reaching Europe,
the product would land in Kenya.

369
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:58,719
Where the people were poorer than us.

370
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,064
The government more corrupt than us,

371
00:29:01,065 --> 00:29:03,225
and youth addict more than us.

372
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:10,710
Mohammed Bobocha was Kenya's Gaitonde.

373
00:29:10,711 --> 00:29:13,791
He controlled 80%
marijuana business there.

374
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,999
And there was a
new dealer in the market.

375
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,760
Purushottam Baria, born stingy.

376
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,506
He was a smart-ass but was a kid.

377
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,104
There was a rumor
among erotica magazine sellers

378
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,145
that he couldn't pop a boner.

379
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,280
I'm too tired.

380
00:29:43,909 --> 00:29:45,189
I'm too tired.

381
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,951
We need to establish
Purushottam in the market.

382
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:52,272
Get Bobocho out of the way.

383
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,560
How?

384
00:29:57,238 --> 00:29:59,158
Same as Junk-King Raja Momin did

385
00:29:59,996 --> 00:30:00,996
for Gaitonde.

386
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:05,400
Over his corpse.

387
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:09,760
If Purushottam will replace
Bobocho what advantage would I have.

388
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:11,880
I'll let you know in due course.

389
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:14,242
What kinda partnership is this,

390
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:18,320
where I can only count
but she knows all the math.

391
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:25,331
Ma'am I want to go back Mumbai.

392
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,240
I still have unfinished
business with Isa.

393
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,240
Isa is not coming back to Mumbai.

394
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:39,080
He got settled in a new country
with new business and fate.

395
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,304
The kind of power he has now, there,

396
00:30:43,305 --> 00:30:44,865
he never had in Mumbai.

397
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,984
You're worthless compared to him today.

398
00:30:48,985 --> 00:30:51,465
And only I know where he lives.

399
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:54,040
So stop yapping on about Mumbai.

400
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:57,120
And prove it me, that your worthy

401
00:30:58,120 --> 00:30:59,744
that I should let you live.

402
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:01,265
This house,

403
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:03,760
and the guards outside are mine

404
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:07,080
and you're able to speak because of me.

405
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,384
So, in this partnership,

406
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:12,009
I'm on 90% and you're on 10.

407
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:14,713
When you work your way up to 50,

408
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:16,594
then we'll talk about partnership.

409
00:31:38,949 --> 00:31:41,613
Whether its a lollipop
or a protein shake

410
00:31:41,614 --> 00:31:42,830
but the reality was

411
00:31:42,831 --> 00:31:45,454
I don't have any short-cuts
for now except for Ma'am,

412
00:31:45,455 --> 00:31:47,704
to be a king again.

413
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:50,448
So I listened to every
bullshit of Ma'am.

414
00:31:50,449 --> 00:31:53,653
And I became Vivian Shah from Gaitonde.

415
00:31:53,654 --> 00:31:55,854
An Indian businessman in Kenya.

416
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:00,239
And called my boys Gaston,
Pascal and Mathu from Bombay...

417
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,719
... here in Kenya.

418
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,280
To set my own gang.

419
00:32:17,661 --> 00:32:21,221
The dairy business got flopped.

420
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:25,399
So daddy came here
and started the coffee business.

421
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,480
And asked me to join in it.

422
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,920
But,

423
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,200
I've other business intents.

424
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,120
Purushottam bro,

425
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,520
I'm new in business here,

426
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,600
you know.

427
00:32:41,541 --> 00:32:43,741
I've an intention to
work with right people.

428
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:45,960
Whom I can trust.

429
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,640
Trust?

430
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:55,240
This's a big word brother Vivian. Trust.

431
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,640
No one is trustworthy here.

432
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,880
One hundred ten million shillings...

433
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,840
I'll buy six ships from you.

434
00:33:11,970 --> 00:33:13,930
You aren't so raw, man.

435
00:33:15,236 --> 00:33:16,956
You want something else.

436
00:33:17,498 --> 00:33:19,418
Purushottam, I've bigger plans.

437
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:21,880
What?

438
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:25,800
Not now.

439
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,920
First, I'll please you,

440
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,400
then I'll offer you drinks.

441
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,560
And when you start thinking
through you dick not head

442
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,560
then I'll tell you.

443
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,920
I'll think about it, brother Vivian.

444
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,480
I have some other work, right now.

445
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,000
Bye.

446
00:33:52,415 --> 00:33:54,399
Purushottam was a Gujarati.

447
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:58,304
And to do business with
a Gujarati you had to create a need.

448
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,599
First, I tipped off Babocho

449
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,840
that Purushottam is trying
to break in his business.

450
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:36,480
And when Purushottam
understood our value

451
00:34:36,813 --> 00:34:38,977
then I played my second card.

452
00:34:44,775 --> 00:34:46,359
- Hello.
- What's up ass-wipe?

453
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,800
- Yes, boss.
- I want Jamila.

454
00:34:49,655 --> 00:34:50,879
Jamila who, boss?

455
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:53,944
Jamila, the one whom
you sent in the jail.

456
00:34:53,945 --> 00:34:55,896
Before meeting her I thought

457
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:58,173
I would never get boner
again, that Jamila.

458
00:34:58,174 --> 00:35:02,418
Boss, actually I got some
issues with her manager.

459
00:35:02,419 --> 00:35:03,443
Manager?

460
00:35:03,444 --> 00:35:07,068
Since we're running out of cash
so all her payments are pending.

461
00:35:07,069 --> 00:35:08,452
Give me her number.

462
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:14,640
Hello.

463
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,400
I want to talk to Jojo.

464
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Who?

465
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,800
Vivian Shah.

466
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:21,999
Who gave you this number?

467
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,159
I got number from Prime
Minister, my dad runs parliament.

468
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:26,640
Give it to Jojo.

469
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,664
Who gave you this number?

470
00:35:28,665 --> 00:35:29,969
I told you.

471
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:33,010
But I'm asking. Who
gave you this number?

472
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,304
So you're the Jojo, right?

473
00:35:37,305 --> 00:35:39,905
- Whoever am I, idiot...
- Look...

474
00:35:43,637 --> 00:35:45,500
- Hello.
- Hello, Bunty?

475
00:35:45,501 --> 00:35:47,644
- Yes, boss.
- That bitch hung up on me?

476
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,509
- Who? Boss.
- Jojo.

477
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,534
She's a hard fish to catch,
slips out of everybody's hand.

478
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,504
Hello.

479
00:35:59,505 --> 00:36:01,305
Bunty gave me the number.

480
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,999
What do you want?

481
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,440
One of your girls, Jamila.

482
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,280
So what?

483
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:10,040
- Yes, that I want.
- Where do you want her?

484
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,000
Did Bunty tell you that I would yell?

485
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:22,140
- Yes.
- Did I yell?

486
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,760
- No.
- So, move on and tell me.

487
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,040
Need her in Kenya.

488
00:36:29,603 --> 00:36:32,123
Clear old accounts and
pay full advance for this.

489
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:33,719
Okay.

490
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,860
And I need a deposit of
50% in cheque, not in cash.

491
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,984
Okay, got, I'll do it.

492
00:36:39,985 --> 00:36:42,985
And one of my boys will
be there and stay with her.

493
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:45,880
Stay with her, where?

494
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:47,999
Wherever Jamila will go.

495
00:36:48,495 --> 00:36:50,439
He will bring her there and take back.

496
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,344
- He'll bring her. He'll take back.
- So, what'll I do? Jerk Off?

497
00:36:54,345 --> 00:36:55,905
Fuck you then...

498
00:36:56,501 --> 00:36:59,021
There're many rhinos
roaming in Kenya fuck anyone.

499
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,960
Do you know who you're talking to?

500
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,480
Yes, I know.

501
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,584
Maybe your daddy owns
parliament, Ganesh Gaitonde

502
00:37:06,585 --> 00:37:08,965
but I don't fucking care for it.

503
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,240
Do you wanna die?

504
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:14,960
Yes.

505
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,080
I've tried four times.

506
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
What's there to try?

507
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,440
Put a gun over your head, take
a shot, brain scrambled and end.

508
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,200
Will you kill me?

509
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:32,280
I'll pay in cash.

510
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,320
Why do you want to die?

511
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,080
I'll send you the invoice.

512
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:37,880
Brother Vivian,

513
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,680
now I'm thinking from my dick.

514
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,720
Tell me what I need to do?

515
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:44,840
Let's fuck Bobocho.

516
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,080
Meaning?

517
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,704
Purushottam, if you want
to do business, do it big.

518
00:38:50,705 --> 00:38:51,865
Otherwise don't do it.

519
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,040
Have you lost your mind?

520
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:58,720
Killing Bobocho isn't a game.

521
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
It is a game, Purushottam.

522
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,000
And I'm the champion of this game.

523
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,960
And it won't be me,
but you, who'll kill him.

524
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:21,159
Malcolm!

525
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,640
Open up! I'm the Home
Minister you sister-fucker.

526
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,240
Malcolm!

527
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:17,200
Hey, bro! Hey, get up!

528
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,640
Stop! Stop it, here!

529
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,840
Stop here.

530
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,884
Wait here, I'll send money from inside.

531
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:33,828
- Why did you sit, if you had no money...
- Sister-fucker, I'm sending you.

532
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:35,332
Fucker! Wait here.

533
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:37,373
Hey, motherfucker.

534
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,304
Hey, you fuckers!

535
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,809
Hey, hey! Motherfuckers!

536
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:45,130
You motherfuckers, I'm a Home Minister.

537
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,000
If you're from Neeli Ghaati,

538
00:40:57,560 --> 00:41:00,080
you won't get a job anywhere in Mumbai.

539
00:41:01,245 --> 00:41:02,749
This used to be a village.

540
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:05,010
This became a Muslim
colony after '93 blasts

541
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:06,639
Why here?

542
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:08,360
Because there were no place left.

543
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:12,864
Hey!

544
00:41:12,865 --> 00:41:13,945
Whose shop is this?

545
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,400
- Is this printed here?
- No.

546
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,640
How long has this press been here?

547
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:26,600
My father's friend got me a job here.

548
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:28,480
So, I'm here.

549
00:41:29,080 --> 00:41:30,320
This is all there is.

550
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,720
I'm asking...

551
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,064
I've been working here from 6 months.

552
00:41:37,065 --> 00:41:39,889
- Where is this printed?
- As I told you I don't know.

553
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:45,800
Excuse me!

554
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,480
Is this printed here?

555
00:41:49,415 --> 00:41:51,599
We don't do these types of jobs, Sir.

556
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,760
Then who does?

557
00:41:54,735 --> 00:41:56,999
It's pulp, sir. Must
be a small offset press.

558
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,107
There's a junk shop in Barkat alley.

559
00:41:59,108 --> 00:42:00,799
You should check there.

560
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,769
What I'm going to tell him now?

561
00:42:02,770 --> 00:42:04,864
He's going to say I'm fucking him.

562
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:07,935
He'll say I'm keeping
a cut in the middle,

563
00:42:07,936 --> 00:42:09,944
what can I say to him?

564
00:42:09,945 --> 00:42:13,105
Tell him that I need my right now...

565
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:17,464
You're supplying to the all
the printing press here, right?

566
00:42:17,465 --> 00:42:22,969
Yes, Sir. We do provide cartons
and transportation to the printers.

567
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:24,210
Why? What happened, Sir?

568
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,920
Have you seen this before?

569
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:34,160
Sir, it isn't very clear.

570
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,720
Yes, its ok. Fine, yeah.

571
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:41,600
Sir...

572
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,000
Hey, you, come here!

573
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:54,960
Majid!

574
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,680
Kamble!

575
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,160
Don't move, don't move!

576
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:20,360
Move, asshole!

577
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:35,960
Awaish.

578
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:37,920
Usman.

579
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,320
I need something.

580
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,800
Go back.

581
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:44,560
Come on.

582
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,440
Hey, get up.

583
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,104
What is this?

584
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:24,240
You've prepared for the war
and don't even know the enemy.

585
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:26,880
Incredible, Sir.

586
00:45:27,600 --> 00:45:29,480
What are they planning to do?

587
00:45:30,615 --> 00:45:32,919
Sir, I'm asking to you what they'll do?

588
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,280
What else they could do?

589
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,600
They'll do what they know best.

590
00:45:38,615 --> 00:45:44,399
Right? Bomb blasts, attacking stations,
hotels... What else they'll do!

591
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,080
What they'll do! What they'll do!

592
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:50,531
Will they blast bombs or
launch a nuclear attack?

593
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,720
What did you say?

594
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:56,760
Exactly what you heard.

595
00:45:58,120 --> 00:45:59,120
Nuclear?

596
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:00,960
A nuclear attack, yes.

597
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:08,904
You mean to say, just like
Hiroshima & Nagasaki?

598
00:46:08,905 --> 00:46:10,145
Like that?

599
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Do I'm look like a moron?

600
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,160
Don't chew Bobocho?

601
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:23,144
Just maul it and
distribute it among people.

602
00:46:23,145 --> 00:46:25,725
You just said a very
hard-ass word, Gaitonde.

603
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,544
I can't understand.

604
00:46:27,545 --> 00:46:30,608
Bobocho doesn't share
his business with anyone.

605
00:46:30,609 --> 00:46:33,113
He keep everything for himself.

606
00:46:33,114 --> 00:46:35,314
Right? He just opened a new casino.

607
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,440
You need fucking 20,000
shilling to enter.

608
00:46:42,335 --> 00:46:44,279
But you won't do the same.

609
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,952
You'll be an umbrella

610
00:46:45,953 --> 00:46:48,888
and each and every boys of
Kenya will work under it.

611
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:51,593
And they'll sell
product where they want.

612
00:46:51,594 --> 00:46:53,250
You'll be the Prime Minister

613
00:46:53,251 --> 00:46:55,558
and the rest will be your parliament.

614
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:21,920
Shoot him in the face. Okay?

615
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,920
People should know who you are!

616
00:47:49,640 --> 00:47:50,640
Kill him!

617
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,480
Shoot, sister-fucker!

618
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,520
You guys continue. The show must go on.

619
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:38,920
I'm a vegetarian, bro.

620
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:41,280
Cut.

621
00:48:42,855 --> 00:48:44,799
Should I cut the finger?

622
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,640
Cut the head, you wimp.

623
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,880
I'll make a souvenir with this
head and hang it on my wall.

624
00:49:19,252 --> 00:49:20,972
Everyone should know

625
00:49:21,413 --> 00:49:23,973
that there is big predator
than lion of Massai Mara,

626
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,680
now in the town.

627
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:28,840
Speak in their language.

628
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:30,800
They didn't understand a shit.

629
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,280
Now, tell me.

630
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,639
Why did you get Bobocho killed?

631
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,720
Bobocho was handling drugs for
the biggest cartel in Dubai.

632
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,800
This cartel funds ISI.

633
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:54,104
Who make blasts in India.

634
00:49:54,105 --> 00:49:57,425
By killing Bobocho you've served
your country for the first time.

635
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:12,000
What's my status now,
have I reached to 15 or 20?

636
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:35,600
Your buddy got involved
in a cartel, last year.

637
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,040
With ISI.

638
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,003
Memorize the number and burn it.

639
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:46,884
We became fish, then
crocodile then lion, and then monkey.

640
00:50:47,223 --> 00:50:51,027
But we evolved from monkey
to humans when we got religion.

641
00:50:51,028 --> 00:50:53,028
This video was in their phones.

642
00:50:53,935 --> 00:50:56,479
Even in this they are
talking about Ghazwa-e-Hind.

643
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:59,359
Hizbuddin, the man of Jihad.

644
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:02,680
The prophet has claimed in the Hadith,

645
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:06,839
that there will be two armies.

646
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,920
It's Shahid Khan's voice.

647
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:12,360
Real religion tells
you what's in the afterlife

648
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:16,360
what man will become in the next life.

649
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:18,840
When will this game end?

650
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,144
You don't believe in
religion, right, Sardar Ji?

651
00:51:30,145 --> 00:51:33,185
So I'll tell you what will happen next.
