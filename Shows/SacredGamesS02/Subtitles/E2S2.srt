1
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:20,869
You think we're fucking fools?

2
00:00:25,149 --> 00:00:26,949
Your phone data is revealed.

3
00:00:28,629 --> 00:00:31,583
Who joined virtual training of
Hizbuddin for two weeks last year,

4
00:00:31,584 --> 00:00:32,773
on Facebook Live?

5
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:40,909
Bhide...

6
00:00:41,749 --> 00:00:43,949
- Bring me some hot water.
- Yes, Sir.

7
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:49,189
Was it you?

8
00:00:55,429 --> 00:00:58,789
Do you think we're fools, that we've
brought you here for amusement?

9
00:00:59,361 --> 00:01:00,361
Huh?

10
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:03,229
Do you really need any
reason to pick up a Muslim?

11
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,068
Find out who else is
there in their family.

12
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:28,629
Have we picked up anyone else?

13
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:30,469
Okay, Sir.

14
00:01:33,989 --> 00:01:35,989
We'll have to try another way.

15
00:01:50,109 --> 00:01:51,109
Didn't sleep, yet?

16
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:56,149
These are your father's belongings.

17
00:01:57,837 --> 00:02:00,957
You were listening to Guruji's
preachment yesterday?

18
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:17,189
Prabhjot Singh Thane West

19
00:02:19,469 --> 00:02:22,269
Papa had joined the Ashram?
He never mentioned it?

20
00:02:22,669 --> 00:02:24,149
He never hid anything.

21
00:02:24,789 --> 00:02:28,509
But you were at Nanded
at that time on your first posting?

22
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:33,149
My dear, Prabhjot,

23
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:35,828
I'm doing well.

24
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,933
Today was the 3rd day of Nashik event.

25
00:02:38,709 --> 00:02:41,042
Guruji said something,

26
00:02:41,043 --> 00:02:43,677
in his preachment that shook me

27
00:02:43,678 --> 00:02:47,158
But his words always
have multiple meanings

28
00:02:49,278 --> 00:02:51,198
Ok, I'm going off to bed.

29
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:57,013
I wonder why

30
00:02:57,014 --> 00:02:59,614
he called me his Ashwathama.

31
00:03:53,309 --> 00:03:54,333
Hello?

32
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,614
Just tell me one thing,

33
00:03:56,389 --> 00:03:59,309
Does one give or receive gifts on Eid?

34
00:04:02,549 --> 00:04:03,669
Gaitonde!

35
00:04:04,869 --> 00:04:06,349
Switch on your TV... watch.

36
00:04:07,429 --> 00:04:08,789
There's a surprise for you.

37
00:04:13,269 --> 00:04:17,108
Hussein Rehmaani allegedly
handled Suleiman Isa's black money

38
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:19,509
and funneled the money
into the African drug trade.

39
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,668
If sources are to be believed

40
00:04:21,669 --> 00:04:25,428
Suleiman Isa is involved
with the infamous Dubai cartel.

41
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:30,529
This my Eid gift, in advance.

42
00:04:31,299 --> 00:04:33,443
You've nothing to give or take.

43
00:04:33,444 --> 00:04:35,468
the first of the planned...

44
00:04:35,469 --> 00:04:38,949
You ran away from Bombay only to
become the government's dog. Huh?

45
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:44,429
I heard that they put you on a
leash and take you for a walk.

46
00:04:44,989 --> 00:04:47,669
And you serve them all the info

47
00:04:48,229 --> 00:04:50,069
that you have sniffed out.

48
00:04:50,989 --> 00:04:52,709
I'll sniff my way to you.

49
00:04:57,109 --> 00:04:58,389
Try pulling

50
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:00,469
your leash

51
00:05:01,349 --> 00:05:02,749
it won't reach me, here.

52
00:05:03,429 --> 00:05:06,349
Hewas right, Sardar
Ji, that's why it irked me.

53
00:05:06,989 --> 00:05:10,429
I've to reach same
level if I want to reach Isa.

54
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:13,949
It was year 1995,

55
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,589
One Ganesh idols were drinking milk,

56
00:05:17,789 --> 00:05:20,389
but other Ganesh was getting thirstier.

57
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:28,286
Hey you fat ass, don't itch your nose?

58
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:30,733
Do it with virility, motherfucker.

59
00:05:30,989 --> 00:05:32,309
Work faster.

60
00:05:34,109 --> 00:05:35,109
Listen you...

61
00:05:35,549 --> 00:05:38,628
You don't have the fuse to that
button which makes you hard,

62
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:41,613
once I cut the wire you'll
never get a boner in your life.

63
00:05:41,614 --> 00:05:42,614
You dick.

64
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,892
To reach Isa's status,
I tried each and every shit job.

65
00:05:55,909 --> 00:05:58,068
At times put money on white powder

66
00:05:58,069 --> 00:05:59,788
and at times on black rhinos.

67
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:01,428
We'll give you $2,000.

68
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,277
No, no my friend, $2,000
that's way to less.

69
00:06:06,278 --> 00:06:07,502
This a rhino horn.

70
00:06:07,503 --> 00:06:10,966
Okay, the powder makes
you a real man. Strong.

71
00:06:10,967 --> 00:06:13,527
Gives you the energy... to you know...

72
00:06:16,629 --> 00:06:20,333
Look, there's huge
demand of this, in China.

73
00:06:20,334 --> 00:06:22,134
And in Kerala...

74
00:06:23,029 --> 00:06:24,029
So...

75
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:25,453
... its a deal?

76
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:29,734
But every business was
over crowded like a cattle class.

77
00:06:42,949 --> 00:06:44,269
- Hey, Harsha?
- Yes?

78
00:06:44,469 --> 00:06:45,949
I want to live with you.

79
00:06:46,469 --> 00:06:47,469
Are you crazy?

80
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:50,469
I'm married.

81
00:06:51,109 --> 00:06:52,389
Don't you love me?

82
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:54,108
Huh?

83
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:57,733
You know, what happens in the
underwear, on the bed...

84
00:06:57,734 --> 00:06:59,113
is not called love.

85
00:07:00,469 --> 00:07:02,469
You scared of Purushottam?

86
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:04,509
He worships me.

87
00:07:08,109 --> 00:07:09,309
And that's the problem.

88
00:07:11,149 --> 00:07:12,149
I'm his goddess...

89
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:14,349
... not wife.

90
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,589
Then let's also make

91
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:18,149
our relationship divine.

92
00:07:22,429 --> 00:07:23,429
Lea...

93
00:07:24,429 --> 00:07:25,949
- What're you doing?
- Come here!

94
00:07:28,349 --> 00:07:29,349
Now you go.

95
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:30,629
Leave.

96
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:32,349
Push me!

97
00:07:35,349 --> 00:07:36,349
Push!

98
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:58,013
Take down the number.

99
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:00,874
+2542609393.

100
00:08:02,389 --> 00:08:04,429
Willson Kamau. He's a friend.

101
00:08:05,149 --> 00:08:06,949
If you've any problem then call him.

102
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,989
Willson, he's Ganesh Gaitonde,

103
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,189
aka Vivian Shah.

104
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:14,529
- Hello!
- Hello.

105
00:08:16,189 --> 00:08:17,909
Two shipments have left for India.

106
00:08:20,629 --> 00:08:23,189
Army... I mean they're
carrying guns of Kenyan Army.

107
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:25,589
Some general is messing with it.

108
00:08:28,244 --> 00:08:31,468
Yadav Ma'am's life was
like a suspense mystery film.

109
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,149
She had a kid daughter in India.

110
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,549
Hello, Pilu?

111
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:37,053
How's your cough, baby?

112
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:39,174
Yadav ma'am casually mentioned

113
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:42,175
that Isa has 50% stake in 'Gentleman',

114
00:08:42,176 --> 00:08:45,416
a premium whiskey brand of Kenya.

115
00:08:46,576 --> 00:08:49,336
Now, I found my plan
to bring Isa to Kenya.

116
00:08:51,644 --> 00:08:53,188
Let's fuck up Gentleman!

117
00:08:53,189 --> 00:08:55,989
I stole Gentleman, and called Kanta.

118
00:08:56,471 --> 00:08:59,491
She taught me how to bootleg whiskey.

119
00:09:00,829 --> 00:09:02,929
Mathu also became expert in making hooch

120
00:09:04,789 --> 00:09:06,748
Boss, it's very easy.

121
00:09:06,749 --> 00:09:09,013
Just insert the coin and start betting.

122
00:09:09,014 --> 00:09:10,988
Nobody must have seen it there.

123
00:09:10,989 --> 00:09:13,508
Bunty offered a smart business idea.

124
00:09:13,509 --> 00:09:15,428
He brought Bombay's game to Kenya.

125
00:09:15,429 --> 00:09:18,289
Video games were a kind of lottery.

126
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:21,589
Cards, betting all on the computer.

127
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:25,188
We opened a casino called 'Cuckoo' and

128
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:27,093
began bootlegging whiskey through it.

129
00:09:27,094 --> 00:09:29,068
That whiskey guaranteed one thing

130
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,348
it would kill 2 out of 10 who drank it.

131
00:09:32,349 --> 00:09:34,198
I started butt-fucking Isa

132
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,028
when 20% of workers went on strike.

133
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:40,948
And also told Bunty to fuck up Parulkar.

134
00:10:00,989 --> 00:10:01,989
Action.

135
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:23,734
Bring the phone to my ear.

136
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:26,789
Didn't smack hard enough?

137
00:10:28,709 --> 00:10:30,469
- Took off his undies?
- No, boss.

138
00:10:30,909 --> 00:10:33,549
Do some batting with the undies
off, and give him the phone.

139
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:35,429
Give him the phone.

140
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,619
Take off undies of this bastard.

141
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,869
How're you, Parulkar Sir?

142
00:10:41,555 --> 00:10:43,875
I told you at that time
don't leave me alive.

143
00:10:44,584 --> 00:10:45,584
Well...

144
00:10:46,069 --> 00:10:47,949
this is like a slow ball of cricket.

145
00:11:18,269 --> 00:11:19,269
Talk.

146
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:21,413
Isa...

147
00:11:21,414 --> 00:11:22,414
... boss.

148
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:26,029
I want Gaitonde's gang to be dead.

149
00:11:27,989 --> 00:11:30,109
I want them extinct from the Earth.

150
00:11:31,509 --> 00:11:32,509
You tell me,

151
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,189
how can it be done?

152
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:38,788
My Gentleman plan hit bull's eye.

153
00:11:38,789 --> 00:11:42,373
People got hospitalized due to drinking
bootleg whiskey, within a year.

154
00:11:42,374 --> 00:11:44,318
And the factory faced protests.

155
00:11:44,319 --> 00:11:47,283
Now Isa would surely
need to come to Kenya.

156
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:51,108
Everything was going well,
but I couldn't forget Bombay.

157
00:11:51,109 --> 00:11:54,629
I used to call two people,
whenever I missed Bombay.

158
00:11:54,994 --> 00:11:55,994
One was Jojo.

159
00:11:56,749 --> 00:11:58,189
Father, bless me for I have sinned.

160
00:11:59,509 --> 00:12:01,629
It's been 3 days since
my last confession.

161
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,069
Yes Jojo, go on.

162
00:12:05,949 --> 00:12:07,829
Father, last night I tried again.

163
00:12:12,029 --> 00:12:14,829
Why do you seek the end
so hungrily my child?

164
00:12:15,909 --> 00:12:18,469
If I were seeking I would
have surely got it by now.

165
00:12:18,709 --> 00:12:19,709
Did I get it?

166
00:12:20,869 --> 00:12:22,389
Death is a coward's way out.

167
00:12:24,229 --> 00:12:26,389
Living through your
guilt is true atonement.

168
00:12:28,269 --> 00:12:31,908
And the second was Dilbagh
Singh who never picked my call.

169
00:12:31,909 --> 00:12:34,708
While crossing the street, two
men on motorbikes approached us...

170
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:36,253
Hey, Dilbagh.

171
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,668
You served so much water to Gaitonde,

172
00:12:38,669 --> 00:12:40,788
give some to this lady as well.

173
00:12:40,789 --> 00:12:42,940
Parulkar got his promotion

174
00:12:42,941 --> 00:12:44,533
and left him hanging.

175
00:12:45,549 --> 00:12:47,229
Add 250 grams of onion,

176
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:49,573
50 grams of ginger.

177
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:50,574
How much?

178
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:52,708
It's ok Sir,

179
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,610
leave it, I don't need money from you

180
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,348
'cause you're the
friend of Gaitonde Sir.

181
00:12:57,349 --> 00:12:59,828
The almighty

182
00:12:59,829 --> 00:13:02,069
talks to us in stories.

183
00:13:02,869 --> 00:13:06,869
Joining our stories, connecting them,

184
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,109
putting us in each other's life.

185
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:14,469
If he has hurt you,

186
00:13:15,149 --> 00:13:17,373
perhaps it was only to save

187
00:13:17,374 --> 00:13:19,517
someone else at that moment

188
00:13:19,518 --> 00:13:21,901
in another part of the world,

189
00:13:21,902 --> 00:13:23,902
escaped from an accident.

190
00:13:29,524 --> 00:13:32,908
Longer ringtone,
it must be him. Don't pick it.

191
00:13:32,909 --> 00:13:34,829
Sartaj!

192
00:13:35,779 --> 00:13:37,043
I'll check it.

193
00:13:37,044 --> 00:13:38,828
How was that?

194
00:13:38,829 --> 00:13:41,142
Why did you take the call?

195
00:13:41,143 --> 00:13:43,133
Go and finish your meal.

196
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:47,548
Why do you keep annoying us?

197
00:13:47,549 --> 00:13:49,349
We don't want anything from you.

198
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,749
What is the grouse with all you fathers?

199
00:13:52,669 --> 00:13:56,149
You saved my life, otherwise fucking
Parulkar would have killed me.

200
00:13:56,429 --> 00:14:00,069
Look, I saved your life, 'cause
I thought they would kill you.

201
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:03,653
I go to the temple every week,

202
00:14:03,654 --> 00:14:05,644
and at the very same time

203
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:07,838
I had to sit in front of you every
week, in the prison.

204
00:14:08,709 --> 00:14:11,509
First I was like, "why I'm
here with this criminal,

205
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,795
instead of serving the Lord."

206
00:14:15,669 --> 00:14:17,309
Do you need an apology from me?

207
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,629
Do you believe in God?

208
00:14:23,469 --> 00:14:24,548
What?

209
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,409
Do you believe in God?

210
00:14:27,409 --> 00:14:28,428
No.

211
00:14:28,429 --> 00:14:29,883
If God didn't exist,

212
00:14:29,884 --> 00:14:32,613
how would humans get the
idea of an entity like God?

213
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:34,937
You only have

214
00:14:36,069 --> 00:14:37,293
one option, now.

215
00:14:37,294 --> 00:14:39,934
You must dedicate yourself to the God.

216
00:14:40,869 --> 00:14:43,348
I told you I don't believe in God.

217
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,242
If not God, you must
have belief in human?

218
00:14:46,243 --> 00:14:47,893
So, find anyone who
can guide you to God.

219
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,031
Who?

220
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:51,032
Any saint...

221
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,309
Any sage...

222
00:14:53,749 --> 00:14:54,829
Any Guru...

223
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,293
Guru.

224
00:14:56,294 --> 00:14:57,294
There are many.

225
00:14:57,589 --> 00:14:59,269
So, there must be one for you.

226
00:14:59,608 --> 00:15:00,608
Search one.

227
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:33,785
This is Anjali's diary.

228
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:35,909
We found it at Trivedi's house.

229
00:15:58,109 --> 00:16:00,933
Sir, we've found these
numbers in Anjali's diary.

230
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,094
Put these numbers on
'permanent tracing'.

231
00:16:03,949 --> 00:16:04,949
Yes, Sir.

232
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:00,109
Aham Brahmasmi. Welcome

233
00:17:02,949 --> 00:17:04,949
Aham Brahmasmi.

234
00:17:07,589 --> 00:17:08,749
Raise your hands up.

235
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:39,469
Please change your clothes here.

236
00:17:48,145 --> 00:17:49,625
What's your work profile?

237
00:17:51,149 --> 00:17:52,229
I've my own business.

238
00:17:52,754 --> 00:17:53,754
Textiles.

239
00:17:55,428 --> 00:17:57,028
What're your expectations?

240
00:17:59,549 --> 00:18:01,429
I'm going through a divorce process.

241
00:18:02,589 --> 00:18:04,749
I've heard this place
gives you inner peace.

242
00:18:45,989 --> 00:18:48,748
My name is Batya Abelman.

243
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,029
I oversee this Ashram.

244
00:18:51,669 --> 00:18:52,669
Pushkar told me

245
00:18:54,149 --> 00:18:56,269
that you've come here seeking peace.

246
00:18:59,069 --> 00:19:00,069
Yes.

247
00:19:02,323 --> 00:19:03,643
My father used to tell me

248
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,075
that Guruji possessed a
great deal of tranquility.

249
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,153
His voice...

250
00:19:10,472 --> 00:19:11,472
His words...

251
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:16,066
Are still with us.

252
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:19,549
How long have you been with Ashram?

253
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:22,530
It's been a very long time.

254
00:19:24,537 --> 00:19:27,137
Now, it feels, it's been 4-5 life spans.

255
00:19:28,189 --> 00:19:30,069
Then you must have witnessed the era

256
00:19:31,229 --> 00:19:32,309
of 20 years before.

257
00:19:33,869 --> 00:19:36,749
When the Ashram's
foundation was laid in Croatia.

258
00:19:37,863 --> 00:19:39,663
It was a great time.

259
00:19:46,309 --> 00:19:48,029
My father used to tell me

260
00:19:49,669 --> 00:19:54,029
that rich businessmen and
famous leader visited Guruji.

261
00:19:54,429 --> 00:19:55,429
Yes.

262
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,469
He would treat everybody the same.

263
00:19:59,507 --> 00:20:01,387
Famous gangsters would visit as well?

264
00:20:02,069 --> 00:20:03,269
That's what I've heard.

265
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,004
Guruji never sent anyone back.

266
00:20:09,058 --> 00:20:11,082
So, has any mafia don ever reformed?

267
00:20:12,975 --> 00:20:15,375
We don't reform people, Sartaj.

268
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:18,190
We just give them perspective.

269
00:20:19,869 --> 00:20:21,589
I want to ask you.

270
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:25,162
What do we learn from Gilgamesh?

271
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:27,549
We learn

272
00:20:28,189 --> 00:20:30,269
that the pursuit of power

273
00:20:30,669 --> 00:20:31,829
and control

274
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,550
is as futile as the
pursuit for immortality.

275
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,772
We learn

276
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:43,669
to enjoy

277
00:20:44,189 --> 00:20:45,189
the gift

278
00:20:46,189 --> 00:20:47,189
of life.

279
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:55,194
Ther's a herbal tea placed next to you.

280
00:20:57,069 --> 00:20:59,149
For this solitude exercise

281
00:21:00,229 --> 00:21:01,229
drink the tea.

282
00:21:07,869 --> 00:21:09,029
Close your eyes.

283
00:21:10,629 --> 00:21:12,869
Let the energy seep in.

284
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,992
Lie back on your meditation mats.

285
00:21:22,712 --> 00:21:23,712
Stretch your legs

286
00:21:25,128 --> 00:21:26,368
feel comfortable.

287
00:21:28,349 --> 00:21:29,349
And relax.

288
00:21:33,069 --> 00:21:40,029
Aham Brahmasmi

289
00:21:46,629 --> 00:21:48,148
You take too much stress, Sir.

290
00:21:48,149 --> 00:21:49,149
Son...

291
00:21:51,829 --> 00:21:53,429
Don't be ashamed.

292
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,549
You tried your best.

293
00:22:02,909 --> 00:22:06,453
What is life if not an exercise in...

294
00:22:06,454 --> 00:22:08,374
in replenishing losses?

295
00:22:09,269 --> 00:22:14,829
Loss is the essence of living.

296
00:22:15,286 --> 00:22:16,470
The elixir.

297
00:22:16,471 --> 00:22:19,311
When everything
starts seeming meaningless

298
00:22:19,312 --> 00:22:21,374
only then the desire...

299
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:28,309
Who's this?

300
00:22:31,389 --> 00:22:32,389
A Guru.

301
00:22:35,024 --> 00:22:36,984
I met him in jail, just like you.

302
00:22:39,269 --> 00:22:41,589
Your Hindi is broken,
and his is too complex.

303
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,349
I'm learning Hindi.

304
00:22:52,949 --> 00:22:55,069
You have such huge contacts.

305
00:22:55,949 --> 00:22:59,149
So, can you help me to
get an... Indian Passport?

306
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,610
Why do you want to go to India?

307
00:23:03,371 --> 00:23:04,371
To do modeling.

308
00:23:05,256 --> 00:23:06,896
With this mushroom nose?

309
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:10,349
Doctor will change it.

310
00:23:15,403 --> 00:23:17,203
Well, I can't go to India.

311
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:21,227
Will you forget me when
you'll become a model?

312
00:23:25,389 --> 00:23:26,909
Will you teach me how to kiss?

313
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,669
Boss.

314
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:38,874
Trivedi is here.

315
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,615
And Isa has come to Nairobi.

316
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,808
Will learn some other time.

317
00:23:50,149 --> 00:23:52,573
- Thank you.
- What's up Trivedi?

318
00:23:52,574 --> 00:23:54,574
You get high on milk?

319
00:23:55,649 --> 00:23:57,569
Much more than this.

320
00:23:58,744 --> 00:23:59,824
Guruji says

321
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:02,709
that no other drink gets
you more high than milk.

322
00:24:03,585 --> 00:24:06,585
Why does everything you say
revolve around that fucking Guru?

323
00:24:07,363 --> 00:24:09,363
Because Guru solves the riddles of life.

324
00:24:10,161 --> 00:24:12,481
Dilbag Singh had also
told me to find a Guru.

325
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:15,750
What will I get by finding a guru?

326
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:17,088
You'll get answers,

327
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:19,648
for each and every question.

328
00:24:21,629 --> 00:24:23,349
How does he know all the answers?

329
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:25,704
He has spent years in austerity.

330
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:27,450
With a pure mind,

331
00:24:28,192 --> 00:24:29,312
and distinct thinking.

332
00:24:31,469 --> 00:24:33,429
There's not an iota of darkness in him.

333
00:24:34,449 --> 00:24:37,529
I suggest, for you also
to believe in Guruji.

334
00:24:38,327 --> 00:24:40,807
Because in the future,

335
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,949
he's going to be our guiding light.

336
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:52,589
Should I have him speak to you?

337
00:24:52,989 --> 00:24:53,989
Huh?

338
00:24:55,311 --> 00:24:57,271
Aham Brahmasmi.

339
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:58,789
Yeah, yeah.

340
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,549
How are you Ganesh?

341
00:25:02,589 --> 00:25:04,389
You said I'd stay alive, hence I am.

342
00:25:04,898 --> 00:25:07,618
Trivedi keeps me
updated with your progress.

343
00:25:08,873 --> 00:25:11,153
But you still have
various tests to face.

344
00:25:11,949 --> 00:25:13,589
Here's a test,

345
00:25:13,963 --> 00:25:17,003
Trivedi told me you've all the
answers so I made this call.

346
00:25:17,626 --> 00:25:19,706
So you're testing me, Ganesh?

347
00:25:21,789 --> 00:25:22,789
Go ahead.

348
00:25:23,189 --> 00:25:25,669
I've had something chocking
my throat for years.

349
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:27,973
I'm going to remove it tomorrow.

350
00:25:27,974 --> 00:25:29,974
You tell me, will I be able to do it?

351
00:25:31,589 --> 00:25:32,909
No, you won't.

352
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:34,693
Why?

353
00:25:34,694 --> 00:25:36,774
There's someone with you

354
00:25:37,709 --> 00:25:40,333
who doesn't want it to happen.

355
00:25:40,334 --> 00:25:41,398
Who?

356
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:44,879
The one who is your
poison, and your elixir, both.

357
00:25:46,029 --> 00:25:48,989
The one who's also impressed
and worried with your energy.

358
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,014
There's no need for such details,

359
00:25:52,015 --> 00:25:54,521
just give me name,
I'll finish him first.

360
00:25:54,909 --> 00:25:59,069
There's a differences in telling
future and sensing future, Ganesh.

361
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:02,229
I don't get what he's saying, you try.

362
00:26:06,961 --> 00:26:08,064
Greetings Guruji.

363
00:26:08,065 --> 00:26:09,505
Yes, Trivedi.

364
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:12,834
He wanted to talk to you,
that's why I called you.

365
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:15,509
If you allow me

366
00:26:16,069 --> 00:26:17,189
I'll hang up the call.

367
00:26:17,629 --> 00:26:18,629
It's okay.

368
00:26:41,589 --> 00:26:44,549
Yes boss, there's one more car,
coming to the airport.

369
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:46,229
Keep following them.

370
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:49,229
Give me a signal as
they reach the tarmac.

371
00:26:59,814 --> 00:27:02,534
Hey, cover their mouths
with cloth. Gag them.

372
00:27:08,069 --> 00:27:09,453
Are you afraid?

373
00:27:09,454 --> 00:27:10,497
Huh?

374
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:12,082
Do you remember everything?

375
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,083
Yes.

376
00:27:15,109 --> 00:27:16,109
Don't be nervous.

377
00:27:16,629 --> 00:27:20,229
Give a hot towel to that motherfucker
as he enters the plane.

378
00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:23,549
He'll put it on the face,
and get unconscious.

379
00:29:05,269 --> 00:29:07,989
Listen, get out of here.

380
00:30:02,429 --> 00:30:04,309
What did you get by screwing me over?

381
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:11,629
I won't stop until I open up his skull.

382
00:30:11,909 --> 00:30:13,613
Save him if you can.

383
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:16,958
There was an attack on the Indian
Embassy in Tanzania, last month.

384
00:30:16,959 --> 00:30:20,302
The one behind it,
is more dangerous than Isa.

385
00:30:20,303 --> 00:30:22,286
He wants to wipe
India off the world map!

386
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:23,287
Then let him.

387
00:30:24,633 --> 00:30:26,393
India isn't my responsibility.

388
00:30:28,512 --> 00:30:30,072
I just want to fuck up Isa.

389
00:30:30,904 --> 00:30:32,664
Bombay will also suffer with India.

390
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,660
And I'm sure, that matters to you.

391
00:30:36,104 --> 00:30:38,344
The way to this man is through Isa.

392
00:30:39,229 --> 00:30:42,069
And this man is as important
to me as Isa is to you.

393
00:31:03,629 --> 00:31:05,709
We've checked
with our Russian resources.

394
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,813
The Pakistanis have
moved the spent nuclear fuel

395
00:31:08,814 --> 00:31:10,657
that was stolen from Ukraine

396
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,462
and docked at the Malindi port in Kenya.

397
00:31:12,463 --> 00:31:14,343
What was the quantity?

398
00:31:15,309 --> 00:31:16,549
Six-hundred kilos.

399
00:31:19,089 --> 00:31:22,369
We will wait for 600kg to
come in? No red flags, nothing?

400
00:31:25,763 --> 00:31:27,123
Any word from Beagle?

401
00:31:27,564 --> 00:31:30,148
We've put a collar, but he's
still not started barking.

402
00:31:30,149 --> 00:31:32,863
- Sir, we can't wait more.
- I agree.

403
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,708
PMO is also very concerned.

404
00:31:34,709 --> 00:31:37,108
What about those
Hizbuddin boys? Any word?

405
00:31:37,109 --> 00:31:39,348
We're checking their
backgrounds. They'll talk.

406
00:31:39,349 --> 00:31:40,349
When?

407
00:31:40,503 --> 00:31:43,303
Sir, we're trying a different
route. We'll let you know.

408
00:32:02,069 --> 00:32:04,349
- What now inspector?
- Who's Wilson?

409
00:32:05,309 --> 00:32:06,389
Ever heard this name?

410
00:32:15,904 --> 00:32:17,864
He's the brother of that Hizbuddin guy.

411
00:32:19,096 --> 00:32:20,136
His name is Saad.

412
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,217
Hasn't been home for a week.

413
00:32:23,201 --> 00:32:24,201
How old is he?

414
00:32:24,664 --> 00:32:25,664
Twenty-one.

415
00:32:26,604 --> 00:32:29,124
The locals here are saying
the cops picked him up.

416
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:31,930
Was he brawling?

417
00:32:33,029 --> 00:32:36,589
I asked the PI here. He said
he did'nt get any report here.

418
00:32:37,264 --> 00:32:39,104
But I've told him to find out.

419
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,610
I'll drive, Sir.

420
00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:48,669
Zoya, come here quickly.

421
00:32:49,589 --> 00:32:53,669
Their people are gunning
down our soldiers every single day.

422
00:32:54,512 --> 00:32:55,512
I want to know.

423
00:32:55,893 --> 00:33:01,017
And India wants to know that why has
a Pakistani woman been lying to us

424
00:33:01,018 --> 00:33:03,458
- for 20 whole years.
- Fucking shit.

425
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:16,349
Why did you leak it?

426
00:33:16,858 --> 00:33:18,978
I told you that I've
nothing else to say.

427
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:21,568
You must have.

428
00:33:21,569 --> 00:33:25,433
Gaitonde's friends, family or enemy?
Anyone of that time?

429
00:33:25,434 --> 00:33:26,434
No.

430
00:33:27,395 --> 00:33:29,875
No? And Wilson?

431
00:33:30,751 --> 00:33:31,911
Who's this Wilson?

432
00:33:34,189 --> 00:33:35,765
When you remember something,

433
00:33:35,766 --> 00:33:38,093
I'll tell you a solution
to this problem.

434
00:33:46,469 --> 00:33:47,669
Look, Awaiz.

435
00:33:48,383 --> 00:33:50,943
Just tell me who were
you printing this for.

436
00:33:53,469 --> 00:33:54,789
Hmm?

437
00:33:56,149 --> 00:33:57,389
Just tell me.

438
00:33:59,709 --> 00:34:00,853
Speak.

439
00:34:00,854 --> 00:34:02,038
Start speaking.

440
00:34:03,144 --> 00:34:06,127
Start speaking. Start it!

441
00:34:06,128 --> 00:34:08,232
Start, just speak!

442
00:34:08,233 --> 00:34:09,576
Speak, speak, Man.

443
00:34:09,577 --> 00:34:10,801
Majid! Majid!

444
00:34:10,802 --> 00:34:13,002
- Wait a second.
- Enough. Majid!

445
00:34:13,669 --> 00:34:15,029
Enough.

446
00:34:15,709 --> 00:34:16,709
Come on.

447
00:34:40,848 --> 00:34:42,168
Drink it.

448
00:34:49,069 --> 00:34:50,229
Your brother's missing.

449
00:34:51,994 --> 00:34:53,274
His name is Saad, right?

450
00:34:55,025 --> 00:34:56,705
You people must have picked him.

451
00:34:57,768 --> 00:34:58,768
He's just a kid.

452
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:02,029
He was never involved
in any wrong thing.

453
00:35:02,464 --> 00:35:04,224
When was the last time you met him?

454
00:35:06,034 --> 00:35:07,034
It's been 10 days.

455
00:35:07,664 --> 00:35:09,224
And you didn't file any report

456
00:35:10,344 --> 00:35:11,984
because if the police had come,

457
00:35:12,349 --> 00:35:14,709
they would find
this bullshit in your press?

458
00:35:16,369 --> 00:35:18,729
We're looking for him in every circle.

459
00:35:19,974 --> 00:35:22,654
We'll find out in the next 4-5 hours.

460
00:35:29,429 --> 00:35:30,973
But before this,

461
00:35:30,974 --> 00:35:32,974
tell me, have you ever met him?

462
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:37,469
Don't be afraid.

463
00:35:42,681 --> 00:35:43,681
He's Shahid Khan.

464
00:35:46,689 --> 00:35:48,089
I saw his face on Facebook.

465
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,480
He doesn't live in India.

466
00:35:57,629 --> 00:35:58,709
He has firm belief

467
00:35:59,629 --> 00:36:01,549
that one day Gazwa-e-Hind will happen.

468
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:03,309
The time for that has come.

469
00:36:05,069 --> 00:36:06,429
I don't know anything else.

470
00:36:08,109 --> 00:36:09,469
I was assigned to

471
00:36:09,749 --> 00:36:16,309
deliver all the papers to Ghazala
Bibi's home in Kamathipura.

472
00:36:20,509 --> 00:36:21,509
Ghazala Bibi?

473
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,709
Nasreen had been come to me
2 years ago from Hyderabad.

474
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:01,788
She learnt the business quickly but...

475
00:37:01,789 --> 00:37:04,312
She got involved 'cause
a bastard client influenced her.

476
00:37:04,313 --> 00:37:06,316
- Which client?
- I don't know, Sir.

477
00:37:06,317 --> 00:37:10,040
She used to go for months.
She went this time as well.

478
00:37:10,041 --> 00:37:12,064
Don't know what disease she picked.

479
00:37:12,065 --> 00:37:13,265
Where's Nasreen now?

480
00:37:20,669 --> 00:37:22,748
In the beginning it seemed like STD.

481
00:37:22,749 --> 00:37:24,498
But its growing so fast....

482
00:37:24,523 --> 00:37:26,308
we haven't received the
medical report's yet

483
00:37:26,309 --> 00:37:30,549
I cant say for certain, but it could
be some kind of nuclear radiation.

484
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:38,853
Hello.

485
00:37:38,854 --> 00:37:40,414
Jojo.

486
00:37:41,151 --> 00:37:42,471
Why'd you call?

487
00:37:43,919 --> 00:37:45,279
They screwed me up.

488
00:37:47,087 --> 00:37:48,087
Who did?

489
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:53,109
Just like you've one Jesus in
your life, I also have mine.

490
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:56,790
But mine is a false god
and a demon, always escapes.

491
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,063
He has good luck.

492
00:38:00,189 --> 00:38:03,029
If I get his horoscope, I'd
know what time to kill him.

493
00:38:03,633 --> 00:38:06,953
The ones who can get early
deaths are very fortunate.

494
00:38:08,298 --> 00:38:12,378
My life-line is on a never ending track.

495
00:38:12,892 --> 00:38:16,372
You talk about death as if you
have a doctorate in all this.

496
00:38:16,712 --> 00:38:19,072
Have you ever seen death, face to face?

497
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,469
Not as much as you.

498
00:38:21,669 --> 00:38:24,789
But whenever I have, I've
always stood firm against it.

499
00:38:25,904 --> 00:38:29,504
Tried embracing it as well, but
again luck wasn't on my side.

500
00:38:30,509 --> 00:38:32,589
Wish I could have guts like you.

501
00:38:33,229 --> 00:38:36,229
I would trick death
into taking me with it.

502
00:38:37,069 --> 00:38:39,029
You can't die until we meet.

503
00:38:40,789 --> 00:38:43,189
I swear I'm dying to meet you.

504
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:47,949
There's no one in
the world I dial just like that.

505
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:52,040
Why didn't you meet
when I was in Bombay?

506
00:38:52,448 --> 00:38:53,968
Not Bombay, it's Mumbai.

507
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:55,594
Hey motherfucker,

508
00:38:55,595 --> 00:38:58,793
even if I call you Kuckoo,
Momo you won't remain Jojo?

509
00:39:04,069 --> 00:39:06,229
Don't call me a motherfucker.

510
00:39:07,389 --> 00:39:09,149
This is the second
time you called me that,

511
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,988
this is my last warning to you.

512
00:39:10,989 --> 00:39:12,909
Do you have any problem with this word?

513
00:39:13,104 --> 00:39:16,864
Hey you faggot, I told you, you
can abuse me with whatever words

514
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,760
but don't use this
word nor say with love.

515
00:39:20,269 --> 00:39:21,269
Understand?

516
00:39:25,848 --> 00:39:26,848
Speak.

517
00:39:28,629 --> 00:39:31,309
I forgot what I had to say.

518
00:39:32,469 --> 00:39:34,149
Okay. Bye then.

519
00:39:35,989 --> 00:39:36,989
Bye.

520
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:40,210
Tell me.

521
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:42,648
How did he find out...

522
00:39:44,032 --> 00:39:45,392
that Ma'am will betray me?

523
00:39:45,949 --> 00:39:47,069
Did you say something?

524
00:39:47,542 --> 00:39:48,542
I had told you.

525
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:51,961
He has all the answers.

526
00:39:53,549 --> 00:39:55,469
But how? Only he can tell.

527
00:39:57,136 --> 00:39:58,416
Do you wanna meet Guruji?

528
00:40:00,168 --> 00:40:01,168
Huh?

529
00:40:02,376 --> 00:40:03,736
Wanna meet?

530
00:40:13,309 --> 00:40:14,829
Time is radioactive.

531
00:40:17,589 --> 00:40:18,709
It decays.

532
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,550
And it stays forever.

533
00:40:23,389 --> 00:40:24,629
It is a circle.

534
00:40:25,789 --> 00:40:27,829
And this circle of time is

535
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:30,989
divided into four eras.

536
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:33,777
4 Yugas.

537
00:40:35,455 --> 00:40:36,455
Satya Yuga.

538
00:40:38,089 --> 00:40:39,089
Treta Yuga,

539
00:40:40,506 --> 00:40:41,506
Dwapara Yuga,

540
00:40:42,113 --> 00:40:43,313
and Kali Yuga.

541
00:40:44,711 --> 00:40:46,471
The first one is Satya Yuga.

542
00:40:48,709 --> 00:40:50,349
The Yuga of truth.

543
00:40:53,309 --> 00:40:54,629
The Yuga of purity.

544
00:40:57,469 --> 00:40:58,789
And you know that

545
00:40:59,749 --> 00:41:01,549
purity is like cocaine...

546
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:05,189
means high class cocaine.

547
00:41:06,149 --> 00:41:07,829
You know how Satya Yuga ended?

548
00:41:08,367 --> 00:41:10,607
Sexual jealousy.

549
00:41:11,451 --> 00:41:13,091
Your orgasm.

550
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:20,570
Your orgasm is the
biggest force inside you.

551
00:41:22,789 --> 00:41:24,229
If you control it.

552
00:41:26,389 --> 00:41:27,493
You win.

553
00:41:27,494 --> 00:41:29,734
There was something in that guy.

554
00:41:30,528 --> 00:41:33,448
He was aware of the past and future.

555
00:41:34,196 --> 00:41:36,116
And then the third one.

556
00:41:37,007 --> 00:41:38,047
Dwapara Yuga.

557
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:42,039
Power and narcissism

558
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:44,869
fuck each other

559
00:41:46,424 --> 00:41:47,424
and give birth

560
00:41:49,001 --> 00:41:52,121
to the thing that we all love.

561
00:41:53,233 --> 00:41:54,433
Materialism.

562
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:58,748
He said man is fucking
himself because of greed and lust.

563
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,813
And entered in
Kali Yuga from Satya Yuga.

564
00:42:00,814 --> 00:42:04,014
A time when war is business.

565
00:42:04,608 --> 00:42:06,408
Religion is business.

566
00:42:08,229 --> 00:42:09,389
Love is business.

567
00:42:11,750 --> 00:42:13,110
Music is business.

568
00:42:13,555 --> 00:42:15,661
And now, there's only one way

569
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:17,083
to get out from this Kali Yuga.

570
00:42:17,084 --> 00:42:20,464
If you stop eating Vitamin
C what will happen to you?

571
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:22,577
Scurvy.

572
00:42:25,097 --> 00:42:26,977
Yes, scurvy, someone said it.

573
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:30,389
And after that

574
00:42:31,126 --> 00:42:34,086
your oldest wounds, childhood wounds

575
00:42:35,389 --> 00:42:36,389
will come back.

576
00:42:37,452 --> 00:42:40,172
Because nothing goes away.

577
00:42:41,869 --> 00:42:43,869
Our oldest memories

578
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:46,149
our deepest joys

579
00:42:48,069 --> 00:42:49,949
everything is inside us.

580
00:42:54,639 --> 00:42:57,079
We just have to control our diet.

581
00:42:58,389 --> 00:43:00,909
Our spiritual emotional diet...

582
00:43:06,069 --> 00:43:09,149
... and we'll find Satya Yuga again.

583
00:43:11,749 --> 00:43:12,829
Together.

584
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,908
That's how he became my third father.

585
00:43:15,909 --> 00:43:18,628
He told me that to keep
our digestive system in order,

586
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:20,646
all the poisons we put in our stomach,

587
00:43:20,647 --> 00:43:23,319
soul, heart, and blood,

588
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,293
it is essential
to keep track and know of.

589
00:43:26,294 --> 00:43:28,677
It's a must that we're aware of it.

590
00:43:28,678 --> 00:43:30,545
Otherwise we'll never know which poison

591
00:43:30,546 --> 00:43:32,786
might turn into cancer and fuck us up.

592
00:43:34,669 --> 00:43:39,413
He said that we all have
our universe in our asses.

593
00:43:39,414 --> 00:43:46,374
- Because...
- Aham Brahmasmi.
