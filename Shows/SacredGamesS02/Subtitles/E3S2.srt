﻿1
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,309
They're twin brothers.

2
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:28,660
Maalam is a decent
man. He loved me a lot.

3
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,443
But, Aalam...

4
00:00:33,078 --> 00:00:34,518
... was a demon.

5
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:37,467
Where did you go with them?

6
00:00:38,576 --> 00:00:39,976
Africa!

7
00:00:42,426 --> 00:00:43,426
America!

8
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:47,535
I don't know where they
picked up the goods from.

9
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:48,616
What goods?

10
00:00:49,858 --> 00:00:51,738
They smuggled things.

11
00:00:52,936 --> 00:00:56,616
What they brought
with them, that time...

12
00:00:58,566 --> 00:01:00,286
... I have no idea.

13
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,323
They threw acid on my skin,

14
00:01:04,324 --> 00:01:06,644
it was burning.

15
00:01:08,256 --> 00:01:11,416
The fuckers didn't wear protection.

16
00:01:13,096 --> 00:01:15,176
Did those two get ill as well?

17
00:01:15,536 --> 00:01:16,536
Or just you?

18
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:23,696
Nasreen?

19
00:01:25,656 --> 00:01:27,296
Where was that stuff delivered?

20
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:53,736
We're trying to track
down their boat, Jibril.

21
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,176
How?

22
00:01:55,276 --> 00:01:57,931
Well, this can detect
radio active material

23
00:01:57,932 --> 00:01:59,300
for about a 100 meters.

24
00:02:00,376 --> 00:02:03,855
It's .25 microsieverts not significant.

25
00:02:03,856 --> 00:02:05,965
What we need is just one trail,

26
00:02:05,966 --> 00:02:08,141
then we can follow it.

27
00:02:09,136 --> 00:02:11,256
- Hello.
- Mohit, this side.

28
00:02:11,656 --> 00:02:13,056
Yes, Mohit. Speak.

29
00:02:13,416 --> 00:02:14,936
Rohit isn't going to school.

30
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,095
He goes somewhere, but
we don't know where.

31
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:20,216
In the middle he disappeared for 2 days.

32
00:02:20,416 --> 00:02:21,896
Mother's really worried.

33
00:02:22,041 --> 00:02:24,681
Tell Mother not to
worry. I'll talk to him.

34
00:02:25,056 --> 00:02:28,660
Sir, don't tell mom I had called.

35
00:02:28,661 --> 00:02:29,821
Okay, I won't tell her.

36
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,136
Hello.

37
00:02:38,176 --> 00:02:39,696
Are your sure they were twins?

38
00:02:41,115 --> 00:02:42,115
Okay, we're coming.

39
00:02:43,602 --> 00:02:46,025
The local PI called.
He's got something for us.

40
00:02:50,776 --> 00:02:52,976
Please come, Sir.

41
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,975
Tell Sir about whatever
you were just saying.

42
00:02:56,976 --> 00:02:59,695
Sir, all I know is that they were ill.

43
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:00,736
That's all I know.

44
00:03:01,348 --> 00:03:03,722
Lots of sailors come here.

45
00:03:03,723 --> 00:03:06,375
Some with girls, some with booze...

46
00:03:06,376 --> 00:03:08,776
Forget about the booze.

47
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,899
This is it.

48
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,536
Maalam Ali.

49
00:03:12,936 --> 00:03:14,656
This is just only the boat number.

50
00:03:14,856 --> 00:03:16,415
Couldn't you get a proper ID?

51
00:03:16,416 --> 00:03:19,255
Don't you know, Adhaar Card
is compulsory for booking?

52
00:03:19,256 --> 00:03:20,616
In future, for sure, Sir.

53
00:03:20,936 --> 00:03:22,360
Did you ever speak to them?

54
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:25,344
They called for traditional
Indian food, curry and rice.

55
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:26,865
- And?
- And...

56
00:03:27,576 --> 00:03:29,056
They used to order medicines.

57
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:31,856
They did call for
medicines every 2-3 days.

58
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:42,136
Are you getting any
big orders now-a-days?

59
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:44,336
For vomiting? Or burns?

60
00:05:21,576 --> 00:05:23,656
You know interconnected network?

61
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:28,976
The one who invented it
belonged to the Satya Yuga .

62
00:05:29,655 --> 00:05:31,335
He gave it to the world for free.

63
00:05:32,758 --> 00:05:36,998
I mean to say, it's the first
indication that Satya Yuga will return.

64
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:39,553
That will end individuality

65
00:05:40,496 --> 00:05:43,616
and a connected consciousness
will return back.

66
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:46,935
You must learn how to use internet.

67
00:05:46,936 --> 00:05:48,456
Aham Brahmasmi.

68
00:05:52,616 --> 00:05:54,776
You have the darkness
of fear inside you.

69
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:58,976
What fear? I don't fear anyone.

70
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:08,816
You exist today...

71
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:10,896
... but won't tomorrow.

72
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:12,496
That's the fear.

73
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,576
That nobody is going to remember you.

74
00:06:16,296 --> 00:06:17,336
That fear.

75
00:06:27,708 --> 00:06:28,908
Please have it.

76
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:32,816
What Gochi is this?

77
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,785
If you like this "Gochi"

78
00:06:36,576 --> 00:06:38,216
then spread it in the world.

79
00:06:42,696 --> 00:06:43,696
Ganesh.

80
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:02,096
Guruji gave me tea
that looked more like...

81
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:03,696
... a red soup.

82
00:07:04,016 --> 00:07:06,375
Who knows what it was made
from and what was in it.

83
00:07:06,376 --> 00:07:07,855
What Gochi did

84
00:07:07,856 --> 00:07:09,856
Guruji fucking blew my mind away.

85
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:47,976
Forgive me, dad.

86
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:49,536
Bastard!

87
00:07:51,496 --> 00:07:53,696
I confessed to the
crime you had committed.

88
00:07:54,336 --> 00:07:56,336
And you left me alone here, to die!

89
00:07:58,976 --> 00:08:00,736
You'll also suffer to death.

90
00:08:01,176 --> 00:08:03,456
You'll face hell for
as long as you live.

91
00:08:03,896 --> 00:08:05,536
You'll never find peace.

92
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,895
That time, it felt like a magic.

93
00:08:12,896 --> 00:08:15,535
suddenly all the heavy weight
of hate poured out of me.

94
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:17,536
And everything felt so light.

95
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:21,535
From that day on, I started a new trade,

96
00:08:21,997 --> 00:08:23,297
The Gochi trade.

97
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:31,404
It was made in Guruji's
Ashram in Dubrovnik.

98
00:08:31,405 --> 00:08:33,868
And I would distribute
it, to all the Ashrams,

99
00:08:33,869 --> 00:08:35,709
and the black markets,
all over the world.

100
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,340
According to Guruji, this was a
way of charity, as well as profit.

101
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,780
His words were'nt any
less affective than Gochi.

102
00:08:48,115 --> 00:08:49,939
Gochi was the only business of mine

103
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:53,900
that Yadav Ma'am didn't control.

104
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,900
I always provided her information

105
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:59,324
and was able to keep her in dark.

106
00:08:59,325 --> 00:09:01,925
And away from Guruji.

107
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:11,220
In 2001 I did business
worth Rupees 250 million.

108
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:17,700
Thay year Al Qaeda fucked America
in return for its' shenanigans..

109
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,900
Whatever one might say, Osama had guts.

110
00:09:23,857 --> 00:09:25,561
In front of the whole world,

111
00:09:25,562 --> 00:09:27,345
he chopped America's, not one...

112
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:29,226
... but Twin Dicks.

113
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:34,219
I'm not feeling this.
I'll take off your Sari?

114
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,659
No! The moon's come out,
he'll be here any minute.

115
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:40,359
Let it go. Let me take it
off. This doesn't excite me.

116
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,379
Hey, please.

117
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,500
Let me take it off.

118
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,274
Do what you want but this way,

119
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,044
it took me 2 hours to wear the Sari.

120
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:49,043
I would've rather
banged a hooker then...

121
00:09:49,044 --> 00:09:50,987
Paid money and gotten whoever I wanted.

122
00:09:50,988 --> 00:09:54,291
Did I invite you here
to come and love me?

123
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:56,212
Talk with respect. Do you understand?

124
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,844
Try to understand!

125
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:01,429
Once our bodies meet it kills the hunger

126
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,053
only then our souls will meet.

127
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:06,214
And I'm telling you the moon's
out; he'll be here any minute.

128
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:09,579
If that's how it is, then go to hell!

129
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:12,020
I don't want to do
anything like this with you.

130
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,204
And we both remain unsatisfied today.

131
00:10:15,205 --> 00:10:16,205
I'll see.

132
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:20,776
And celebrate your ceremony
because it'll be your last one.

133
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:23,977
Once I've chopped off his neck,
you'll come running to marry me.

134
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:29,002
He's my husband.

135
00:10:29,726 --> 00:10:30,726
Do you understand?

136
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,721
I told you I am a married woman.

137
00:10:34,663 --> 00:10:35,663
Huh?

138
00:10:37,171 --> 00:10:39,571
And talk to me with
respect, I'm not your whore.

139
00:10:51,137 --> 00:10:53,897
Do you know who was
behind the Bombay Blasts?

140
00:10:54,878 --> 00:10:55,878
It was Isa.

141
00:10:56,158 --> 00:10:57,382
And who was behind Isa?

142
00:10:57,383 --> 00:10:58,423
Pakistan.

143
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:00,016
ISI.

144
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,921
And do you know who
handled the whole operation?

145
00:11:03,922 --> 00:11:05,746
Yeah, you had told me about some guy

146
00:11:05,747 --> 00:11:07,307
Showed me the picture as well.

147
00:11:07,737 --> 00:11:11,057
After the Bombay Blasts, this
'guy' has become very big.

148
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:14,056
He's earned a name.

149
00:11:14,057 --> 00:11:17,281
So big, that he's got
the nerve to call his boss

150
00:11:17,282 --> 00:11:20,736
the ISI chief, a coward, openly!

151
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:24,897
Sounds like a cool guy.

152
00:11:25,617 --> 00:11:27,977
He's now set up his own
terror group in India,

153
00:11:28,457 --> 00:11:30,137
It's called Hizbuddin.

154
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,537
His name is Shahid Khan.

155
00:11:39,297 --> 00:11:41,537
Do I have to kill him
or abduct him for you?

156
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:43,057
Either will do.

157
00:11:47,497 --> 00:11:49,697
I won't do it out of
love for this country.

158
00:11:51,297 --> 00:11:52,737
I want 50 million shillings.

159
00:11:53,897 --> 00:11:55,577
I want a Rolls-Royce.

160
00:12:01,841 --> 00:12:04,121
Shahid Khan's in talks
with the Dubai underworld.

161
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:07,634
He wants money for Hizbuddin.

162
00:12:07,997 --> 00:12:09,974
It's very difficult to get information

163
00:12:09,975 --> 00:12:12,117
out of the Dubai underworld,

164
00:12:12,554 --> 00:12:13,674
there's only one way.

165
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:18,057
You'll have to talk to Isa.

166
00:12:19,057 --> 00:12:21,637
If you be just as nice to Isa

167
00:12:22,777 --> 00:12:25,257
as you were when you
spoke about the Rolls Royce

168
00:12:26,337 --> 00:12:27,657
then our job will be done.

169
00:12:42,811 --> 00:12:43,811
What the fuck...

170
00:12:44,935 --> 00:12:45,935
Hold on.

171
00:12:49,095 --> 00:12:50,095
We're done now.

172
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:52,607
If I see you again...

173
00:12:53,144 --> 00:12:55,624
I'll bury your ass
in the fucking ground,

174
00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:15,536
I thought I closed her chapter.

175
00:13:15,537 --> 00:13:16,856
But I had no idea

176
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:19,697
that she had me by the balls.

177
00:13:21,617 --> 00:13:22,937
Go, go, go.

178
00:13:27,897 --> 00:13:30,377
My whole business used to run on cash.

179
00:13:31,337 --> 00:13:33,016
And Yadav Ma'am

180
00:13:33,017 --> 00:13:35,776
ratted me out to the authorities

181
00:13:35,777 --> 00:13:37,777
I started losing 50 to
100 million each day.

182
00:13:55,976 --> 00:13:57,011
Any day now

183
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:58,923
they would just stick
up their hand up my ass

184
00:13:58,924 --> 00:14:01,624
and even snatch away my last dime.

185
00:14:10,497 --> 00:14:12,497
- Guruji?
- Yes.

186
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,659
What's the problem, Ganesh?

187
00:14:19,457 --> 00:14:22,577
If I could know everything
beforehand, like you do.

188
00:14:24,057 --> 00:14:25,457
there would be no trouble.

189
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:29,696
Give me all your problems.

190
00:14:38,165 --> 00:14:39,645
This is my problem.

191
00:14:42,097 --> 00:14:45,497
There was a demon... called Apasmara.

192
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:47,382
Who had

193
00:14:48,537 --> 00:14:50,257
a very unique superpower.

194
00:14:51,217 --> 00:14:53,377
He could control

195
00:14:54,177 --> 00:14:56,537
anyone's memory.

196
00:14:57,057 --> 00:14:58,657
But he had a weakness, also.

197
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:01,577
He used to crave for attention.

198
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,137
One day,

199
00:15:04,417 --> 00:15:05,617
Apasmara

200
00:15:07,217 --> 00:15:08,737
cast such a spell

201
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:11,657
on Goddess Parvati

202
00:15:12,337 --> 00:15:15,697
that she had lost all her Godly powers.

203
00:15:16,857 --> 00:15:19,497
Then Lord Shiva, in full of rage,

204
00:15:21,537 --> 00:15:23,657
reached Apasmara's cave

205
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:26,217
and started his angry dance "Tandava".

206
00:15:26,665 --> 00:15:29,142
The high resonance
of Lord Shiva's Damroo

207
00:15:29,143 --> 00:15:32,213
made the veins of Apasmara's ears burst.

208
00:15:32,214 --> 00:15:35,174
He fell at Lord Shiva's feet

209
00:15:35,777 --> 00:15:38,017
and Nataraja stomped on his head.

210
00:15:38,878 --> 00:15:40,318
Since then till today,

211
00:15:40,977 --> 00:15:42,977
Nataraja is holding that position.

212
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:47,471
Apasmara was pissed that
despite being so powerful

213
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,176
nobody gave two hoots about him.

214
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:51,257
That's why he fucked with Lord Shiva.

215
00:15:51,632 --> 00:15:53,616
And I was in a similar position!

216
00:15:53,617 --> 00:15:56,576
For the first time in my
life I had earned so much cash

217
00:15:56,577 --> 00:15:59,936
but nobody knew about me
neither in Bombay nor Mombasa.

218
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:04,936
I was stranded like a ghost of the sea.

219
00:16:04,937 --> 00:16:05,976
I decided

220
00:16:05,977 --> 00:16:08,937
I won't keep quiet like Apasmara.

221
00:16:09,377 --> 00:16:13,937
Won't let the world forget
who Ganesh Gaitonde is.

222
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:39,887
Where's your boat?

223
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,410
Jibril?

224
00:16:42,337 --> 00:16:44,177
Where did you deliver the goods?

225
00:16:46,617 --> 00:16:48,337
Do you remember Nasreen?

226
00:16:49,465 --> 00:16:51,505
She told us that Aalam loved her truly,

227
00:16:51,835 --> 00:16:53,115
but Maalam was a rascal.

228
00:16:54,017 --> 00:16:55,017
Its a lie.

229
00:16:57,446 --> 00:16:58,446
So you're Maalam?

230
00:17:02,657 --> 00:17:04,577
She was in the hospital for 12 days...

231
00:17:06,261 --> 00:17:10,445
She was in such pain that
she was begging for death.

232
00:17:10,446 --> 00:17:13,206
You'll also be in the same
condition in a few days time.

233
00:17:14,377 --> 00:17:15,577
Allah's the greatest.

234
00:17:24,017 --> 00:17:25,977
You brought the stuff for Ghazwa-e-Hind?

235
00:17:26,777 --> 00:17:27,777
Tell me,

236
00:17:28,217 --> 00:17:29,657
where has it been 'written'?

237
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:31,937
Have you even read the Hadith?

238
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,177
Yeah yeah... Dajjal.

239
00:17:41,041 --> 00:17:43,345
Where it is? Who is he?

240
00:17:43,346 --> 00:17:46,306
- Donald Trump is a Dajjal...
- Shut up, motherfucker!

241
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:48,857
Someone just said it
and you believed it?

242
00:17:49,097 --> 00:17:52,261
Even you believed whatever 'they' said.

243
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:53,982
Motherfucker...

244
00:17:56,857 --> 00:17:58,177
Look, what's this?

245
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:01,176
Do you know who this is?

246
00:18:01,177 --> 00:18:02,417
Ibn-e-Qasim!

247
00:18:02,977 --> 00:18:05,496
He had captured India,
a thousand years ago.

248
00:18:05,497 --> 00:18:08,593
Ghazwa-e-Hind has already
happened a thousand years back.

249
00:18:08,594 --> 00:18:09,998
They're taking you for a ride.

250
00:18:09,999 --> 00:18:11,881
And the stuff you've brought here

251
00:18:11,882 --> 00:18:13,465
will destroy the whole city.

252
00:18:13,466 --> 00:18:15,529
Are you grasping anything, motherfucker?

253
00:18:15,530 --> 00:18:19,090
That's good, then....
All the infidels will die.

254
00:18:20,309 --> 00:18:22,333
Bastard.

255
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:24,118
Majid, stop it. What are you doing?

256
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,119
You're going to decide...

257
00:18:26,493 --> 00:18:28,293
Relax. Calm down.

258
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,608
Just leave.

259
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:32,033
Why did you keep me, if
you had to kick me out.

260
00:18:32,034 --> 00:18:33,234
Go ask Parulkar that.

261
00:18:42,785 --> 00:18:44,465
Take a break. Go home.

262
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:54,783
So...

263
00:18:54,784 --> 00:18:57,064
How's Operation Makhdoom going?

264
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:00,069
Rolling on, Sir.

265
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:05,749
Intelligence Bureau guys
don't usually like cops.

266
00:19:06,789 --> 00:19:08,029
Yes, Sir.

267
00:19:20,897 --> 00:19:22,057
Did they find Bhonsle?

268
00:19:27,749 --> 00:19:29,788
We haven't been told anything yet, Sir.

269
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:31,789
Does one need to be told to find out?

270
00:19:39,589 --> 00:19:42,429
Had heard that he's been kept
in some safe-house. But...

271
00:19:44,229 --> 00:19:45,229
He's not talking.

272
00:19:51,709 --> 00:19:53,029
Sir, I'll take your leave.

273
00:19:53,432 --> 00:19:56,552
Listen, you will be attending
the marriage anniversary right?

274
00:19:57,638 --> 00:19:58,638
Yes, Sir.

275
00:19:59,549 --> 00:20:01,549
- Jai Hind, Sir.
- Jai Hind.

276
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:25,733
You want more? Do you?

277
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:27,814
- Aye, motherfucker.
- Easy. Easy.

278
00:20:30,316 --> 00:20:32,299
Have you guys gone mad?

279
00:20:33,325 --> 00:20:35,868
I've been telling you
constantly I don't know...

280
00:20:35,869 --> 00:20:38,549
... I don't know anything
about anything nuclear...

281
00:20:52,629 --> 00:20:54,709
You remember Patil
Sir's helicopter crash?

282
00:20:56,229 --> 00:20:58,429
Nobody figured out who was behind it.

283
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,948
So... Are you threatening to kill me?

284
00:21:01,949 --> 00:21:03,509
- I'm not threatening.
- Then?

285
00:21:04,265 --> 00:21:06,265
Nobody will miss you if you disappear.

286
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:08,709
Sir,

287
00:21:09,749 --> 00:21:10,909
Delhi.

288
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:21,349
Sir.

289
00:21:21,869 --> 00:21:23,429
Jai Hind, Sir.

290
00:21:23,869 --> 00:21:24,989
Sisterfucker...

291
00:21:25,349 --> 00:21:26,389
No, Sir.

292
00:21:27,429 --> 00:21:28,909
Sir, we can't let him go yet.

293
00:21:29,845 --> 00:21:30,845
No, Sir.

294
00:21:31,149 --> 00:21:32,149
No...

295
00:21:32,869 --> 00:21:34,249
Sir, media...

296
00:21:35,324 --> 00:21:37,268
Media won't get to know. I promise.

297
00:21:37,269 --> 00:21:38,909
All my boys are very smart, Sir.

298
00:21:41,084 --> 00:21:42,148
We need this, Sir.

299
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:45,629
It's very serious, Sir. It's
part of Operation Makhdoom.

300
00:21:48,989 --> 00:21:49,989
Yeah...

301
00:21:51,749 --> 00:21:52,869
Fine, Sir.

302
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,360
But I need a...

303
00:21:55,999 --> 00:21:57,399
... one hour with him, Sir.

304
00:21:58,007 --> 00:21:59,407
Thank you, Sir. Jai Hind.

305
00:22:08,629 --> 00:22:09,629
One hour.

306
00:22:11,807 --> 00:22:14,470
Ma'am, what should I
state as the occupation?

307
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:15,831
Write anything you want.

308
00:22:16,124 --> 00:22:18,708
Ma'am the yearly installments
need to paid for this.

309
00:22:18,709 --> 00:22:20,789
- Who will be paying for that?
- Her lover.

310
00:22:22,152 --> 00:22:24,352
The one screwing will
have to get screwed.

311
00:22:24,704 --> 00:22:25,984
Ma'am do one thing.

312
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:28,481
Get this insurance
policy from someone else.

313
00:22:32,634 --> 00:22:35,274
My girls go to all kinds of assholes.

314
00:22:36,069 --> 00:22:38,069
In case they get a disease... or die...

315
00:22:38,419 --> 00:22:39,819
Insurance is needed, right?

316
00:22:40,389 --> 00:22:41,389
Fill it out.

317
00:22:42,589 --> 00:22:43,709
Fill the form!

318
00:22:55,943 --> 00:22:57,543
- Hello.
- Still alive?

319
00:22:58,018 --> 00:23:00,738
I'm angry right now, we'll talk later.

320
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:02,569
Why act so pricey?

321
00:23:04,003 --> 00:23:05,827
You won't be missed even if you die.

322
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:07,692
You are alive and tell me who cares?

323
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:09,717
Nobody even mentions
your name in Mumbai.

324
00:23:09,718 --> 00:23:10,798
Don't talk hogwash.

325
00:23:11,224 --> 00:23:17,028
All of Mumbai knows about Ganesh
Gaitonde and Kukoo's love story.

326
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,108
Ass-wipe, I told you I
haven't heard about it.

327
00:23:19,109 --> 00:23:20,949
You will now, if you haven't before.

328
00:23:21,909 --> 00:23:22,909
Decided...

329
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,460
I'm going to produce a movie.

330
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,269
Movie?

331
00:23:28,128 --> 00:23:29,128
What movie?

332
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:30,709
Story about my life.

333
00:23:36,199 --> 00:23:38,719
Kukoo... Kukoo...

334
00:23:44,415 --> 00:23:46,335
I'll show you, motherfucker.

335
00:23:47,869 --> 00:23:48,909
Hey!

336
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,949
I'm making a movie, motherfuckers.

337
00:23:52,296 --> 00:23:53,616
Is Boss saying something?

338
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,660
Just nod your head.

339
00:24:01,629 --> 00:24:05,469
Aye! Is Ram G Verma checking
the print of his film here?

340
00:24:08,964 --> 00:24:09,988
Shubu...

341
00:24:09,989 --> 00:24:11,749
It's Shivaang, Sir.

342
00:24:11,949 --> 00:24:13,188
How's it sounding?

343
00:24:13,189 --> 00:24:16,469
- Big fan, Sir.
- Idiot, I'm asking how's it sounding.

344
00:24:20,134 --> 00:24:21,134
Good morning, Sir.

345
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,629
Are you going to shoot me?

346
00:24:25,269 --> 00:24:26,708
You don't want to shoot me?

347
00:24:26,709 --> 00:24:28,069
Aye motherfucker,

348
00:24:28,829 --> 00:24:32,669
I've bought your movies tickets
in black. Why would I kill you?

349
00:24:33,734 --> 00:24:34,934
Is it for real?

350
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:38,988
Motherfucker, do you want
to make another film or no?

351
00:24:38,989 --> 00:24:41,629
Or should I end your biopic right here?

352
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:47,299
We bagged a big time
director Ram G Verma

353
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:49,053
to direct the movie.

354
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:53,029
Why's all this so green?

355
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:55,708
Green screen.

356
00:24:55,709 --> 00:24:57,649
Yeah, but why?

357
00:24:58,464 --> 00:25:00,744
Then how do I create India in Africa?

358
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:03,588
Boss, he's showing Africa as India...

359
00:25:03,589 --> 00:25:05,489
India is not so green...

360
00:25:07,034 --> 00:25:08,874
Fucking looks like the Aarey jungle.

361
00:25:09,109 --> 00:25:11,109
He'll make this green into India later.

362
00:25:11,304 --> 00:25:14,768
I wonder why do you work for him,
rather he should work for you.

363
00:25:14,769 --> 00:25:15,828
What did he say?

364
00:25:15,829 --> 00:25:18,309
I made a Gopalmath in Africa,

365
00:25:19,189 --> 00:25:21,213
Zoya became Kukoo... And that dickhead,

366
00:25:21,214 --> 00:25:23,158
Rajeev Sawla, became Gaitonde.

367
00:25:23,159 --> 00:25:24,919
My dad was a beggar.

368
00:25:25,549 --> 00:25:27,069
I did not like that.

369
00:25:27,869 --> 00:25:29,548
He killed my mother.

370
00:25:31,898 --> 00:25:33,018
Then I met Kukoo,

371
00:25:34,109 --> 00:25:35,709
India's Audrey Hepburn.

372
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:39,009
Audrey Hepburn? Not Meryl Streep?

373
00:25:39,189 --> 00:25:41,150
Meryl Streep... Julia Roberts...

374
00:25:41,151 --> 00:25:43,049
Audrey Hepburn... She was everything...

375
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:48,773
Meryl Streep is Meryl Streep!

376
00:25:48,774 --> 00:25:51,174
Five, six, seven, eight.

377
00:25:58,589 --> 00:26:00,589
It'll be the expressions...

378
00:26:01,684 --> 00:26:05,068
♪ Let the bottled up love ooze out... ♪

379
00:26:05,069 --> 00:26:08,789
♪ Let it kiss the lips,
and slide down... ♪

380
00:26:09,563 --> 00:26:11,883
And then the villain enters.

381
00:26:12,764 --> 00:26:13,788
Isa!

382
00:26:13,789 --> 00:26:15,309
I show him the colt...

383
00:26:16,545 --> 00:26:19,745
... and take Kukoo away with
me from right under his nose.

384
00:26:20,189 --> 00:26:21,829
Under the nose...

385
00:26:24,312 --> 00:26:26,192
After showing the colt...

386
00:26:27,636 --> 00:26:28,636
colt...

387
00:26:31,509 --> 00:26:33,293
Ohh... that colt!

388
00:26:39,749 --> 00:26:42,069
♪ Hey uptown girl ♪

389
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:48,148
♪ let those hips sway... ♪

390
00:26:48,149 --> 00:26:51,269
Boss, I've written some kickass
lines, keeping you in mind.

391
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:55,028
"I'm the downtown don, and
you're the uptown girl..."

392
00:26:55,029 --> 00:26:58,228
"Let's meet mid-way, hidden away..."

393
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:02,453
♪ I'm the downtown don,
and you're the uptown girl ♪

394
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:07,354
♪ I'm the downtown don,
and you're the uptown girl ♪

395
00:27:07,524 --> 00:27:11,348
♪ Let's meet mid-way, hidden away ♪

396
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:15,428
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

397
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:18,489
You are the hero of the movie...

398
00:27:19,589 --> 00:27:22,089
Isa is nothing compared to you...

399
00:27:22,709 --> 00:27:26,309
He's not even the antagonist,
he's a stooge, a comedian...

400
00:27:26,669 --> 00:27:31,268
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

401
00:27:31,269 --> 00:27:35,548
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

402
00:27:35,549 --> 00:27:37,693

403
00:27:37,694 --> 00:27:39,597
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

404
00:27:39,598 --> 00:27:41,878
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

405
00:27:50,629 --> 00:27:52,149
I won't be coming.

406
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Not even for me?

407
00:27:54,247 --> 00:27:55,887
Precisely why I won't come.

408
00:27:57,743 --> 00:27:59,023
That's fine.

409
00:28:00,069 --> 00:28:01,469
I'll save you a seat.

410
00:28:07,883 --> 00:28:09,723
Bombay's not safe for you, Ganesh.

411
00:28:27,342 --> 00:28:30,422
Everyone told me not to
go for the movie premiere.

412
00:28:34,869 --> 00:28:39,629
But I wanted to see people
go crazy seeing my story.

413
00:29:19,404 --> 00:29:21,468
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

414
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,748
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

415
00:29:23,749 --> 00:29:25,789
♪ How you doin' girl ♪

416
00:29:43,269 --> 00:29:45,735
Nobody came, film folk,

417
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,293
my business folk,
faggoty politicians. None!

418
00:29:51,709 --> 00:29:53,929
I'd put tonnes of action in the movie,

419
00:29:54,789 --> 00:29:58,453
Even made Gaitonde die like
Amitabh Bachchan in the movies,

420
00:29:58,454 --> 00:30:01,094
thinking it would make people emotional.

421
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,532
But people were laughing!

422
00:30:05,829 --> 00:30:09,629
Guruji's story of Apasmara
hit me like a bullet.

423
00:30:10,785 --> 00:30:14,425
The motherfucker had too big a
head, and that is why he had fallen.

424
00:30:15,749 --> 00:30:17,189
I was also down and out.

425
00:30:17,879 --> 00:30:21,679
Nobody remembered Ganesh
Gaitonde. Nobody feared him.

426
00:30:22,866 --> 00:30:24,289
Even I was thinking...

427
00:30:24,290 --> 00:30:27,394
"What does this dickhead
Ganesh Gaitonde want"?

428
00:30:27,395 --> 00:30:30,138
It's the public's right to know...

429
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:32,922
that why do you keep a low profile
when it comes to your nationality.

430
00:30:32,923 --> 00:30:35,466
- I am...
- Why have you consistently and vehemently

431
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,850
denied your involvement with
the gangster Ganesh Gaitonde,

432
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:41,451
- inspite of making a debut with his film.
- Exactly...

433
00:30:42,207 --> 00:30:44,807
Tell me, how does your blood not boil?

434
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:46,166
Tell?

435
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:48,388
If someone breaks
into your home tomorrow

436
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:50,333
and raises their hand

437
00:30:50,334 --> 00:30:52,974
against you, will you just
sit quietly or retaliate?

438
00:30:53,229 --> 00:30:58,789
Our revered Holy Cow that
even our saints worship...

439
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,292
these butchers rip open her
stomach whenever they want.

440
00:31:03,273 --> 00:31:06,393
But our brave-hearts avenge
by butchering those butchers...

441
00:31:10,488 --> 00:31:13,688
... and continue to prove that
Maharashtrians are still alive!

442
00:31:14,087 --> 00:31:17,471
Why are the North
Indians trying to become

443
00:31:17,472 --> 00:31:19,696
the protectors of Hinduism?

444
00:31:19,697 --> 00:31:21,817
Why aren't you going to school?

445
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:23,593
What if Mom finds out?

446
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:34,567
And what's this nonsense
have you come to listen?

447
00:31:35,626 --> 00:31:37,346
These people first brainwash you,

448
00:31:37,847 --> 00:31:39,967
then use you and then
leave you to die...

449
00:31:42,287 --> 00:31:44,287
You did the same with Dad...

450
00:31:44,807 --> 00:31:46,167
left him to die...

451
00:31:46,732 --> 00:31:49,652
Aye, Rohit... Don't run your mouth.

452
00:31:50,073 --> 00:31:51,073
Yeah?

453
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,167
Take this.

454
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:01,287
Some money...

455
00:32:02,247 --> 00:32:03,287
... give this to Mom.

456
00:32:05,056 --> 00:32:06,056
Don't want it.

457
00:32:06,962 --> 00:32:08,442
I'm there for Mom and Mohit.

458
00:32:09,499 --> 00:32:13,282
You moron. Sir, is
trying to help you out...

459
00:32:13,283 --> 00:32:14,283
Kamble...

460
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:23,287
Rohit...

461
00:32:24,047 --> 00:32:25,047
Rohit...

462
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:33,607
You look tense.

463
00:32:38,287 --> 00:32:39,687
There is some guilt inside.

464
00:32:41,207 --> 00:32:42,247
Let it come & rise.

465
00:32:43,487 --> 00:32:45,407
Don't suppress it.

466
00:32:46,367 --> 00:32:50,007
Don't counter instinct
with intelligence.

467
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:54,007
Easy to say...

468
00:32:57,247 --> 00:32:59,887
Instinct has been around far longer,

469
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:03,447
and your instinct has brought you here.

470
00:33:04,247 --> 00:33:05,367
Follow it.

471
00:33:17,007 --> 00:33:18,007
What's in this?

472
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,567
Suppression will only

473
00:33:33,847 --> 00:33:35,327
increase the darkness.

474
00:33:36,487 --> 00:33:38,087
Let your fear rise.

475
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,167
'Letting go' is virtuous.

476
00:34:08,487 --> 00:34:10,207
What's this?

477
00:34:11,527 --> 00:34:13,407
He had gone with you, right?

478
00:34:14,687 --> 00:34:16,847
And was walking on his own two feet.

479
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:21,487
What should I tell my kids?

480
00:34:24,927 --> 00:34:26,967
What should I do now?

481
00:35:20,267 --> 00:35:21,331
Hello?

482
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:24,035
I'm sending you the
location. Reach there.

483
00:35:24,036 --> 00:35:25,036
Of what?

484
00:35:27,007 --> 00:35:28,007
Hello?

485
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:44,887
Don't give him more than 5 minutes.

486
00:35:52,247 --> 00:35:53,687
Poonam, that's Sartaj Singh.

487
00:35:54,087 --> 00:35:55,687
Poonam, her daughter.

488
00:35:56,207 --> 00:35:57,967
Let me know if you need anything.

489
00:35:59,567 --> 00:36:00,767
Please come.

490
00:36:15,167 --> 00:36:16,487
Please come.

491
00:36:21,367 --> 00:36:22,446
Mom,

492
00:36:22,447 --> 00:36:25,047
the one I'd spoken to you about...

493
00:36:25,727 --> 00:36:26,767
... he has come.

494
00:36:30,327 --> 00:36:31,327
Ma'am,

495
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:34,647
when did you meet Ganesh
Gaitonde for the first time?

496
00:36:49,447 --> 00:36:50,447
In Kenya.

497
00:36:51,367 --> 00:36:53,767
Mom was deputed in the
Indian Embassy there.

498
00:36:54,327 --> 00:36:56,007
What all did he do for you Ma'am?

499
00:36:57,047 --> 00:36:58,767
She can't remember much.

500
00:36:59,207 --> 00:37:02,191
Brain damage... and Scotoma...

501
00:37:02,192 --> 00:37:04,196
So she can't see much either.

502
00:37:04,197 --> 00:37:08,740
Half her vision is blurred
with random subconscious images.

503
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:11,981
- Why are you asking her these questions?
- Give her a chance to speak.

504
00:37:13,487 --> 00:37:14,967
She might remember something.

505
00:37:18,127 --> 00:37:19,127
Ma'am, Anjali...

506
00:37:21,207 --> 00:37:22,927
How do you know Anjali Mathur?

507
00:37:26,127 --> 00:37:27,607
Your name was in her diary.

508
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:31,927
Bloody, Mathur...

509
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:35,967
Bloody? Why?

510
00:37:40,287 --> 00:37:43,807
Mr. Mathur, Anjali's
father, was Mom's colleague.

511
00:37:45,567 --> 00:37:46,567
Mom...

512
00:37:48,487 --> 00:37:51,486
It'll be a very difficult night
if she gets more disturbed.

513
00:37:51,487 --> 00:37:52,487
You should leave now.

514
00:37:53,407 --> 00:37:56,646
Shhh...

515
00:37:56,647 --> 00:37:58,887
It's okay. It's okay.

516
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:02,047
Please. I'm sorry. Please leave.

517
00:38:05,767 --> 00:38:07,527
It's all right.

518
00:38:16,407 --> 00:38:17,431
Hello?

519
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:19,072
You broke my heart today.

520
00:38:20,807 --> 00:38:22,487
I had told you I won't be coming.

521
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,246
I don't watch Amitabh Bachchan's movies,

522
00:38:26,247 --> 00:38:29,606
Shahrukh Khan's or Salman
Khan's. Why would I watch yours?

523
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:32,446
You run a brothel, provide escorts...

524
00:38:32,447 --> 00:38:35,127
... and watching a simple
movie is sin for you?

525
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,287
I've committed lots of sins.

526
00:38:40,167 --> 00:38:42,087
I've committed tons of sins.

527
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:45,407
But ever since this pilgrimage started,

528
00:38:48,007 --> 00:38:49,991
killing myself has also become a sin.

529
00:38:49,992 --> 00:38:53,191
How bad a sin did you commit that
you needed to go on a pilgrimage?

530
00:38:53,582 --> 00:38:55,206
We don't call it pilgrimage...

531
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:59,286
Whatever they call it, You tell me
your sins, and I'll tell you mine.

532
00:38:59,287 --> 00:39:01,007
Everyone knows about yours...

533
00:39:01,899 --> 00:39:02,979
Everybody knows what?

534
00:39:04,087 --> 00:39:05,447
Your movie.

535
00:39:08,287 --> 00:39:10,047
Your big sin.

536
00:39:10,687 --> 00:39:13,527
Your biggest sin. The one you produced.

537
00:39:14,167 --> 00:39:15,527
Why do you speak like that?

538
00:39:17,727 --> 00:39:19,527
Because you wanted to be a hero...

539
00:39:21,047 --> 00:39:22,127
which you are not.

540
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:25,367
You are Gaitonde.

541
00:39:26,247 --> 00:39:27,567
And Gaitonde's a villain.

542
00:39:29,447 --> 00:39:32,367
And villains don't
dance... which you did.

543
00:39:33,327 --> 00:39:34,527
If you hadn't done that,

544
00:39:36,030 --> 00:39:38,310
your movie would've
been successful for sure.

545
00:39:39,687 --> 00:39:42,487
No fucking body would
have forgotten Gaitonde,

546
00:39:43,767 --> 00:39:47,687
but on screen you turned a
normal guy into a dickhead.

547
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:51,086
Why don't you actually die for real?

548
00:39:51,087 --> 00:39:52,727
Why don't you come and kill me?

549
00:39:54,847 --> 00:39:57,007
I'll be indebted to you even as a ghost.

550
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,647
- Jojo.
- Yeah?

551
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:03,767
I'm coming.

552
00:40:04,107 --> 00:40:05,166
Where?

553
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:07,087
I'm... I'm coming.

554
00:40:07,447 --> 00:40:10,127
Hey, Gaitonde, I... I was...

555
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:16,687
Turn the car around.

556
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,231
But boss, the airport's this way.

557
00:40:19,232 --> 00:40:20,232
Turn the car around.

558
00:40:21,287 --> 00:40:24,006
- Boss, it's not safe.
- Motherfucker, head to Bandra.

559
00:40:25,032 --> 00:40:26,175
Boss...

560
00:40:27,561 --> 00:40:29,701
Fucking Hell. Here come our fans.

561
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,731
Drive faster.

562
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:35,396
Bunty. Take down a number.

563
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:36,397
Take down a number.

564
00:40:36,765 --> 00:40:42,909
+254202609393.

565
00:40:42,910 --> 00:40:45,493
Call this number and inform them.

566
00:40:45,494 --> 00:40:46,494
- Okay.
- Stop the car.

567
00:41:13,316 --> 00:41:14,340
Hello?

568
00:41:14,341 --> 00:41:15,685
I'm calling from Bombay.

569
00:41:15,686 --> 00:41:18,206
Ganesh Gaitonde has been
picked up by Parulkar.

570
00:41:20,127 --> 00:41:21,767
Are you getting what I'm saying?

571
00:41:25,247 --> 00:41:27,807
I should've known I would run into you.

572
00:41:28,807 --> 00:41:31,167
My ass had been fucking
twitching since morning.

573
00:41:34,007 --> 00:41:35,007
My business,

574
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:38,406
has become massive now, Parulkar.

575
00:41:38,407 --> 00:41:39,407
Mine as well.

576
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,607
I've stopped playing with bats.

577
00:41:46,927 --> 00:41:49,006
You're... making a
mistake again, Parulkar.

578
00:41:49,007 --> 00:41:50,487
I won't make a mistake again.

579
00:41:53,127 --> 00:41:54,287
Run, bastard.

580
00:41:56,727 --> 00:41:57,727
Run!

581
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,767
- Turn him over.
- Come on.

582
00:42:03,958 --> 00:42:08,901
Parulkar... My business
has crossed borders...

583
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:12,846
Just ask. Just ask for
whatever you want. Parulkar!

584
00:42:23,142 --> 00:42:24,166
Hello?

585
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,479
The enquiry on the Nusrat
Wahaab Encounter Case

586
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,567
is quite heated.

587
00:42:28,247 --> 00:42:30,871
If the media were to get
your phone call recordings,

588
00:42:30,872 --> 00:42:33,352
the Chief Minister might not like it.

589
00:42:35,203 --> 00:42:36,203
Who's this?

590
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:38,717
Save my number as Mother India.

591
00:42:39,287 --> 00:42:41,207
Let Gaitonde go.

592
00:42:42,687 --> 00:42:44,991
He won't come back to Mumbai.

593
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:46,112
Give the phone to him.

594
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:52,807
Leave him.

595
00:43:01,327 --> 00:43:03,007
I'm doing this out of patriotism,

596
00:43:04,087 --> 00:43:05,727
you should do it for survival...

597
00:43:06,887 --> 00:43:07,887
What?

598
00:43:31,854 --> 00:43:34,197
Please make sure you find the evidence.

599
00:43:34,198 --> 00:43:35,922
Check every corner, every nook....

600
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:36,966
Found anything?

601
00:43:36,967 --> 00:43:39,630
There are no fingerprints,
Sir. There's nothing missing.

602
00:43:39,631 --> 00:43:41,711
Somebody was searching
for something, Sir.

603
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,911
Any information from Maalam & Aalam?

604
00:43:43,912 --> 00:43:47,072
Hmm. They haven't said anything yet.

605
00:43:47,295 --> 00:43:48,775
What if we separate the two?

606
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:52,271
Sir, Maalam is scared of his brother.

607
00:43:52,272 --> 00:43:54,232
He won't cut in on what
he's been taught by Aalam.

608
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:56,846
And Aalam will take
some time to trust us.

609
00:43:56,847 --> 00:43:59,167
They'll talk only when
they are terrified...

610
00:44:01,047 --> 00:44:04,207
And they'll be terrified
only when they are alone.

611
00:44:05,307 --> 00:44:06,326
Sir?

612
00:44:06,327 --> 00:44:07,527
Who do you want to take out?

613
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:10,246
Sir, give us some time. They'll speak.

614
00:44:10,247 --> 00:44:12,807
If we had time we wouldn't
be going through this shit.

615
00:45:17,527 --> 00:45:18,607
Brother, Aalam?

616
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,207
Where's Aalam?

617
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:26,327
Brother, Aalam...

618
00:45:27,327 --> 00:45:28,327
Huh?

619
00:45:37,018 --> 00:45:38,658
Aalam & Nasreen...

620
00:45:39,555 --> 00:45:40,555
They both left.

621
00:45:43,047 --> 00:45:44,527
You want to get cured, right?

622
00:46:00,327 --> 00:46:02,087
We've been at sea for years now...

623
00:46:04,527 --> 00:46:06,647
Brought lots of goods for Shahid.

624
00:46:07,607 --> 00:46:08,607
This...

625
00:46:09,487 --> 00:46:10,807
... was the last delivery.

626
00:46:12,207 --> 00:46:13,207
Maalam,

627
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:15,327
handle the boat. I'm going to sleep.

628
00:46:16,727 --> 00:46:18,207
It was a long one...

629
00:46:19,837 --> 00:46:21,557
that's why we took Nasreen along.

630
00:46:25,691 --> 00:46:29,515
Picked up the stuff
from a ship in Malindi...

631
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:31,076
Not here.

632
00:46:35,223 --> 00:46:36,223
Easy.

633
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:46,687
Keep it here.

634
00:47:10,242 --> 00:47:12,002
We woke up one morning...

635
00:47:13,047 --> 00:47:14,687
... and she started vomiting.

636
00:47:19,087 --> 00:47:22,007
Those guys didn't make the full payment.

637
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:26,007
We delivered half the goods in Mandvi

638
00:47:27,327 --> 00:47:30,007
- and hid the boat.
- Where?
