8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,680
Shot!

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:32,480
pitch me the same way, perfect.

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,120
One more!

11
00:00:36,815 --> 00:00:38,759
Catch it! Catch it, catch it!

12
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,480
Yes! We got him!

13
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,439
It's above the waist, no ball.
Tell 'em it's a 'No-ball'.

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,504
No-ball!

15
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:49,065
How is it a no-ball?

16
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,039
It was above the waist...

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,839
Don't cheat.

18
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,959
- Umpire said it's above the waist.
- It was below the waist...

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:59,904
- Cheating?
- You know the rules? Stay in your limits.

20
00:00:59,905 --> 00:01:02,945
Take him away or I'll
bury him right here.

21
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,960
You got quite a mouth, Aurangzeb.

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,680
Get out of here.

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
Muslim Faggot.

24
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,759
- Motherfucker.
- Hey...

25
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:18,039
Do you wanna fight you, bastard?

26
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,064
Are you crazy, Saad? Get out of here.

27
00:01:20,065 --> 00:01:22,465
Hey Balu... Vijya..!

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,839
What happened? Aye, bring the car out.

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,840
Let's go! Get out of here.

30
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,560
Kushal, he's bleeding a lot.

31
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
This has become a country of foreigners

32
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:42,280
and there is no room
for Hindus in Hindustan.

33
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,040
Sir, historically,

34
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,359
first the Moghuls came when we
were fighting amongst ourselves.

35
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,759
Then the Britishers came, we
got divided into class and caste.

36
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:54,359
We got another opportunity
during the Partition,

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,320
but we chose non-violent protests!

38
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,080
Look at 'them', they've
been at it for 2000 years

39
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,280
and we are stuck electing governments

40
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,160
to give us better petrol prices.

41
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,360
- Fools of the highest ord...
- 1400 years.

42
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,640
Huh?

43
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,640
Islam has existed for
1400 years, not 2000.

44
00:02:17,116 --> 00:02:18,639
What are you here for?

45
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,520
Do you know someone by the name of Saad?

46
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,439
The one who comes to play cricket?

47
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,024
Did something happen last week?

48
00:02:25,025 --> 00:02:26,105
He's a crappy pitcher.

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,960
I hit 'em all out of the park.

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,600
You know what he did?

51
00:02:33,172 --> 00:02:34,675
He bust open Ramesh's head.

52
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:36,959
- Blood was flowing out like Niagara Falls.
- Then?

53
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,800
- Then we took Ramesh to the hospital.
- And Saad?

54
00:02:40,824 --> 00:02:43,864
- He must have run away.
- Have anyone's number from his team?

55
00:02:49,992 --> 00:02:51,312
Thanks Kushal.

56
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:57,200
Sir, why are you
messing around with them?

57
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,760
Keep an eye on him.

58
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,160
Motherfucker, what have you done?

59
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,840
Speak.

60
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,480
Speak!

61
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,800
Say it, motherfucker.

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,440
Say it, motherfucker. Say it.

63
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,300
Say it. Say it.

64
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,560
Motherfucker.

65
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,640
- Let's deal.
- I know you want a deal, cunt.

66
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,400
Did your boss not teach you

67
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,320
to respect Sir Isa?

68
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,680
You want a deal? Show me your loyalty.

69
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,440
Bring forth your hand...

70
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:39,880
Prove your loyalty. Do
it or get out of here.

71
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,360
Remember the taste.

72
00:05:55,615 --> 00:05:58,519
This is exactly what Shahid
also doesn't understand.

73
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,840
It's okay to have enemies,

74
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,720
but one must learn to respect the enemy.

75
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,319
Let me get rid of Shahid.
That'll end all problems.

76
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:10,320
Nope.

77
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,320
I know he's an idiot,

78
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,040
but idiots can come in handy as well.

79
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,200
Fifty million rupees.

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:19,680
Millions won't do.

81
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,600
I want to go to Jerusalem,

82
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,360
see the Qubbat As-Sakhrah.

83
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,720
And obviously I can't do
that on a Pakistani passport.

84
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:32,360
So, go to your owner, wag your tail

85
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,640
and get me an Indian
diplomatic passport.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,520
It'll be done.

87
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,680
I'll take off.

88
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:52,560
Yes, you may leave.

89
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
"I'm the downtown don"

90
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,279
was a big mistake on my part...

91
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,200
Just need all your blessings now...

92
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,879
Bunty, that motherfucker
had become a poet...

93
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,384
And Zoya, an actress.

94
00:07:21,385 --> 00:07:26,008
And I had become Ms. Yadav's
pet dog, who had to lick asses

95
00:07:26,009 --> 00:07:28,992
Isa's or any other Sheikhs
that was served to me.

96
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,480
South.

97
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,800
Public.

98
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,640
In whose ass should
I shove up this info?

99
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,600
This guy always gives
useless information.

100
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,720
Where to?

101
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,600
Bombay.

102
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,599
It's my birthday tomorrow.

103
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,880
I have a shoot.

104
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:07,520
I'll call up Bunty.

105
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,840
He'll get the director to call in sick.

106
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,000
Listen, there's a party.

107
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,479
Aditya Johar will also be therel.

108
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,120
Your Hero will be there as well.

109
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,360
Yes, he's helping me out.

110
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:25,080
Screwing is 'helping' now, is it?

111
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,815
Ladies and gentleman I present to you

112
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:43,304
the voice of the evening...

113

120
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,304
This was my most
expensive birthday party

121
00:09:33,305 --> 00:09:35,544
and also the shittiest.

122
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:43,559
Even amongst a crowd I felt lonely.

123
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,359

I would keep thinking
why did I meet Isa?

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:04,080
Miss Yadav had me pressed

00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,920
Aham Brahmasmi, Ganesh.

133
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,240
Aham Brahmasmi, Guruji.

134
00:10:29,557 --> 00:10:31,837
You have my blessings
on your birthday, Ganesh

135
00:10:32,295 --> 00:10:34,119
I know you're in a dilemma.

136
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,760
This story will help you understand.

137
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,280
During the war of the worlds
between the Gods and Demons,

138
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,080
there was a time when

139
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,280
the demons were dominant.

140
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:53,200
So, the Gods sent an
innocent looking boy,

141
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,800
Kacha, into the Demons'
settlement as a spy.

142
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,240
Shukracharya - the Demons' Guru

143
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,400
knew the secret of Mrit Sanjeevni.

144
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,680
Mrit Sanjeevni was an elixir
that granted immortality

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:15,320
it could bring a dead
person back to life.

146
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,320
And as time went on,

147
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:25,240
Devyani... Shukracharya's
daughter fell in love with Kacha.

148
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,720
The Demons' got apprehensive.

149
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,828
They did not want the secret
of their most powerful weapon

150
00:11:32,829 --> 00:11:34,944
to reach the Gods.

151
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,080
Hence, the Demons killed Kacha.

152
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,760
Seeing Devyani in despair,

153
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,360
Shukracharya used Mrit Sanjeevni to...

154
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:48,320
bring Kacha back to life.

155
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,500
Devyani was elated,

156
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,280
And Kacha received assurance
that he could always escape death.

157
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:58,880
Then?

158
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,480
The rest of the story will follow later.

159
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:05,920
You still have many births
to go through, Ganesh.

160
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:08,280
For now, just understand

161
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:14,040
that to conquer death one
needs to die several times.

162
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:15,560
How?

163
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,480
How can I go to my next birth?

164
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,400
It is not so easy, Ganesh.

165
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,160
Not strength... sacrifice is required.

166
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:32,880
- I'll do it.
- Sacrifice?

167
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,680
What's the first step?

168
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:42,159
The tube you found is
definitely an initiator

169
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,480
to generate neutrons
for the fission reaction.

170
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,932
North Korea has been working on

171
00:12:46,933 --> 00:12:49,607
an assembled fishing
device for some time.

172
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:51,128
And I think

173
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,879
they're now selling the
design in the black market.

174
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,493
But this design doesn't look like

175
00:12:57,494 --> 00:12:59,327
it needs too many of these tubes.

176
00:12:59,328 --> 00:13:03,691
Not exactly, even 2 or 3 would
do the job of initiating the bomb.

177
00:13:03,692 --> 00:13:06,492
The other tubes just work as boosters.

178
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,120
How many tubes do you
estimate they have?

179
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,679
These ordinary looking
tubes that you see here

180
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,319
could be the biggest
weapon to enter India.

181
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:23,399
Our lab reports indicate that
they contain lithium deuteride.

182
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,039
This could be boosters
for a fission bomb.

183
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,240
Maalam informed us
there are 10 such tubes.

184
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,360
And we have retrieved five of them.

185
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:35,280
We believe that they will want
all of them for maximum impact

186
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,600
We have also unlocked Aalam's laptop

187
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,624
and we found a dark net chat room

188
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,265
that the Hizbuddin was
using to communicate.

189
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,120
Rama is working on deciphering
these chats even as we speak.

190
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,160
Fateh... Victory.

191
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,080
What's this, Sir?

192
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,040
16,7,17.

193
00:14:00,538 --> 00:14:01,738
16th July?

194
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,240
Today's the 8th.

195
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:08,639
From what we have decoded,
16th of July could be D-Day.

196
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,919
We need to scan every
corner of the city.

197
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,479
Follow the nuclear fuel

198
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,430
Coordinate with all check-points.

199
00:14:14,431 --> 00:14:15,674
Yes, Sir.

200
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:17,718
Any phone numbers obtained
from Anjali's diary

201
00:14:17,719 --> 00:14:19,542
been activated?

202
00:14:19,543 --> 00:14:21,323
Not yet, Sir. But we've got Shahid Khan

203
00:14:21,324 --> 00:14:23,671
and his main man Haroon's voice samples.

204
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:26,335
- What did we get from the chats, Rama?
- We're analyzing it, Sir.

205
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,260
Analyzing is not enough,
participate in it.

206
00:14:29,261 --> 00:14:32,241
Gain their trust. This is
the best chance we all have.

207
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:34,868
Get us a meeting with Shahid Khan.

208
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,520
Hey! Get up!

209
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,560
Have a seat, Sir.

210
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,560
He told me over the phone.

211
00:15:02,295 --> 00:15:05,039
Sir, the truck belonged
to Gujarat or Maharashtra?

212
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,640
Gujarat, it had come from Kutch.

213
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,439
Sir, thousands of trucks come.

214
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,399
And you check all of them, isn't it?

215
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,160
Four chatroom histories
have opened up so far.

216
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,640
What are they speaking
about in this chat?

217
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,880
We found some information on Saad.

218
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:26,840
His friends told us he brawled
during the cricket match.

219
00:15:27,842 --> 00:15:30,082
But no one knows where
he went afterwards.

220
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:32,520
But we'll find out soon.

221
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,160
Trust us.

222
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,440
Now tell us what this is.

223
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,479
This is not like Whatsapp chat.

224
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,799
Each person has limited
access to information

225
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,439
whatever is designated to them.

226
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:46,800
What's this 'Girl 6' speaking about?

227
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,560
Who is this?

228
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:52,160
Is this Shahid Khan?

229
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,200
Yeah.

230
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,640
Some stuff is missing.

231
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,720
The person with the laptop is saying

232
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,200
the stuff won't be
given without the money.

233
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,280
Shahid Khan's replied that
the money has been stolen

234
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,920
and is asking for cooperation.

235
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,240
Search more. What's been
written about the money?

236
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,784
You can't see old
messages by scrolling up.

237
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:24,305
Will we find something by
typing in the search box?

238
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:25,920
Yes.

239
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,479
Yes, Sartaj.

240
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:45,120
Markand Sir, how much money
was found from Jojo's home?

241
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:46,359
Why?

242
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,720
Please tell me, Sir.

243
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,279
Rupees 900.8 million.

244
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,280
Please tell me the exact number, Sir.

245
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,600
Rs. 908,676,000.

246
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,199
Rs. 908,676,000.

247
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:58,720
- But what are you doing?
- I'll tell you soon, Sir.

248
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,240
It's working.

249
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,519
What's written here?

250
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:15,080
He's praising a delivery that
was made on the 10th of June.

251
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,760
Rama, write "We are ready to
give the material for 25,000,000."

252
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:26,320
Let's negotiate with Shahid Khan.

253
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,076
But wouldn't they get suspicious

254
00:17:30,077 --> 00:17:32,224
if we suddenly change what we're saying.

255
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:34,705
No, he is afraid. He'll definitely meet.

256
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
Oh!

257
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,440
Rama, we're running out of time.

258
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,200
Sir, Can I get you anything Tea, Coffee?

259
00:17:52,475 --> 00:17:54,179
Take out the list for 10th June.

260
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,199
Huh?

261
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:56,880
Take out the list for 10th June.

262
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,400
Is there a problem, Sir?

263
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,920
Bring the CCTV footage.

264
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,199
Sir, the thing is...

265
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,240
I'll tell you...

266
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,159
- Take him along.
- Sir, I'll explain...

267
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,360
- One second, let me talk to him...
- Get up.

268
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,160
Sir.

269
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,360
Sir, will you have
some? It's local sweet.

270
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:31,040
No, thank you. Got something yet?

271
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,760
No, Sir. No response yet.

272
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,680
You joined after 26/11?

273
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,960
Yeah,

274
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,160
Joseph Sir had brought me in.

275
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,400
At the time, it would
poison me on the inside.

276
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,880
I would feel angry and
wanted to do something.

277
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,520
And now?

278
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,760
Now I'm used to it.

279
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,560
There's a lot of stress,

280
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:07,720
but it's fun.

281
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
And you?

282
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,120
I don't know.

283
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:20,400
These days, I'm unable to
understand what am I suppose to feel

284
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,520
- Got any response?
- No response, Sir.

285
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,534
Next time please consult somebody

286
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,344
before you send out
these random messages.

287
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,120
Where were you?

288
00:19:33,990 --> 00:19:37,294
Should've prayed to Allah to
give your men some sense as well.

289
00:19:37,295 --> 00:19:40,239
Please vent somewhere else.
All of us are just as stressed.

290
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,439
- What's your stress?
- What's your problem?

291
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,224
- Your work.
- We are working.

292
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:45,728
Should I call Parulkar?

293
00:19:45,729 --> 00:19:47,989
Sir please! Move back!

294
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,319
Majid is doing his work, Sir.

295
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,560
Sir... Sir...

296
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,880
response is here.

297
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,120
Password protected...

298
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,343
Can we get it out of Maalam?

299
00:20:00,344 --> 00:20:03,824
He doesn't know anything about
computers. Aalam used to handle it all.

300
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:05,728
Rama, what do you think?

301
00:20:05,729 --> 00:20:07,529
It's risky to try a hack right now.

302
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,558
If we make a mistake, it will alert them

303
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,200
and we would loose our only chance.

304
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,600
You're home early today.

305
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,400
Half the people just use me,
and the other half doubt me.

306
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,120
They'll take me off this case.

307
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:56,440
They'll be foolish to do that.

308
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,800
Saw any houses today? Like anything?

309
00:21:13,316 --> 00:21:16,756
Mum & Dad also must be having a
hard time in this small apartment.

310
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,320
If we end up liking an apartment,

311
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:23,080
its housing society doesn't
end up liking our name.

312
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:27,240
Today, even Mahesh gave up,
saying he's shown us all the flats.

313
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,760
Told me to select a flat in a
society which allows Muslims.

314
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,920
Otherwise the one in Dahanu...

315
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:34,520
Yeah,

316
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,280
Have the Muslims stay in a place
where even electricity has'nt reached.

317
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,640
I made a mistake by asking
Dad to move to Mumbai.

318
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,680
He's quite an influential politician.

319
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:02,920
Congratulations, Sir.

320
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,400
- Thanks.
- Arshia.

321
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
Hi, how are you?

322
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,280
Sir...

323
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:13,120
Three weeks ago some
goods had reached Mandvi.

324
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,079
Someone high up made a
call and let it bypass

325
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,080
the transportation-taxation department.

326
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,240
Who do you think that could be?

327
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,280
You just got here?

328
00:22:24,972 --> 00:22:26,972
- Sir.
- There's a sweets counter.

329
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:28,920
Quite good. Try it.

330
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,200
Go!

331
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:38,680
Hello, Sir.

332
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,783
Hey Megha. How are you?

333
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:43,488
- Congratulations.
- Long time. You're looking gorgeous.

334
00:22:43,489 --> 00:22:45,169
- Thank you.
- Come join us.

335
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,880
- That's Umesh.
- Hi Umesh.

336
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,519
One more please.

337
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,200
Thank you for coming.

338
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,920
Yeah!

339
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,759
- Megha.
- Hi.

340
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,379
I just heard the news. Congratulations.

341
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,399
Thank you.

342
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,959
I'll just be back in a bit. Wait for me.

343
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,960
Yes...

344
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:13,840
When's the wedding?

345
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:17,800
Next month.

346
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:19,200
Why all of a sudden?

347
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,200
Sartaj let's talk later.

348
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:35,319
You've known him for six months.

349
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,360
- Please, let's talk later.
- Is someone pressurizing you?

350
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,160
There's no pressure Sartaj.

351
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm happy.

352
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,479
Please don't ruin it.

353
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,800
How does he manage to keep you happy?

354
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,000
I couldn't learn in years.

355
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,360
And in six months, he...

356
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,920
Will he teach me?

357
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,040
Should I ask him?

358
00:24:04,895 --> 00:24:06,879
How to... keep Megha happy...

359
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,880
I'm pregnant.

360
00:24:28,525 --> 00:24:29,685
Hello Sartaj.

361
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,320
How are you?

362
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,520
She had a problem with me drinking.

363
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,440
I was always proper,

364
00:25:16,106 --> 00:25:18,461
but she would continue to
fuss over some petty arguments

365
00:25:18,462 --> 00:25:20,223
we had in the past. She
used to say everyday,

366
00:25:20,224 --> 00:25:22,224
"Quit drinking, it is not good for you."

367
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,440
She never treated me as
an equal in our marriage.

368
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,879
She was the doctor,
and I was the patient.

369
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:31,360
I was blamed as the reason
for all our problems.

370
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,480
She was the best thing that
happened to me, but I...

371
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:39,640
I was just a husband for her.

372
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:43,640
Sartaj, she has a right
to take her decisions.

373
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,320
When did I oppose that?

374
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:48,839
Yes, but you're feeling betrayed.

375
00:25:48,840 --> 00:25:50,640
You hardly know anything about me.

376
00:25:51,654 --> 00:25:54,198
I leave the lights on,
when I leave in the morning

377
00:25:54,199 --> 00:25:56,759
Just so that I can feel like
there's someone else when I return.

378
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,680
Someone staying with me in the house

379
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,960
This isn't about loneliness...

380
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,599
but about self-worth, Sartaj.

381
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:07,920
So it's all my fault?

382
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:10,320
Self-worth isn't one's fault,

383
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,698
but the entire universe

384
00:26:12,699 --> 00:26:14,880
comes together to
make you feel that way.

385
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,839
And how do you know that?

386
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,960
Do you want to go deeper?

387
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
Don't take it, Sartaj.

388
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,240
I am telling you, don't take it.

389
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,000
This Gochi is freaky.

390
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:20,720
Once its caught you, you'll
never be able to shake it off.

391
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:50,480
I'm pregnant.

392
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,879
When did you find out?

393
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,280
What's the point of this?

394
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:57,704
And we had mutually decided
that we won't have a child.

395
00:27:57,705 --> 00:27:58,865
Didn't we?

396
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:02,000
- Didn't we Sartaj?
- Yes, we did.

397
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,240
- Because you didn't want to.
- Yes, I didn't want to.

398
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,919
My choice has no importance?

399
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,999
That's why I got the abortion done.

400
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,544
It was you who kept harping about
the lack of space on this planet...

401
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:18,105
Yeah, but we also ended
up fine... In this city.

402
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:20,960
And are we fine?

403
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,040
Are we fine, Sartaj?

404
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,840
I feel alone.

405
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
I have become tired of myself.

406
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,120
When my boys ask for instructions,

407
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,960
I'm slowly dying on the inside.

408
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:55,000
I know what to do.

409
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,520
But why

410
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:00,960
I'm lost.

411
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Ganesh, it's the curse of being God...

412
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,960
I am no God.

413
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,040
I'm just running away.

414
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:25,600
From?

415
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,800
I don't know from whom?

416
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,760
Father, What are you doing Father?

417
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:58,560
I was weak, that's
why you became this...

418
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,399
It's not your fault. It's
all my fault forgive me.

419
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,064
Ganesh... forgive me.

420
00:30:04,065 --> 00:30:05,889
Ganesh! Ganesh!

421
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,353
Ganesh... forgive me.

422
00:30:07,354 --> 00:30:09,354
Ganesh! Ganesh... forgive me.

423
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:40,040
I was born a conflict, Sartaj.

424
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,960
My mother was Palestinian,

425
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:47,240
and my father was a Jewish.

426
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,560
We started Living in Paris.

427
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,880
Life was a midsummer night's dream...

428
00:30:57,640 --> 00:31:00,520
Hectic, crazy, fun...

429
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,520
The first Intifada happened

430
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,360
and more than a 1000
Palestinians were killed.

431
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:11,120
And my mom started
feeling like a coward.

432
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,320
Living away from Palestine while
her friends were facing the bullets.

433
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:22,240
She left me this letter and
went back to her revolution.

434
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,680
I was 14.

435
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,520
She was 38.

436
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,360
She died the next year.

437
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,280
It means: Follow your instinct.

438
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,560
For a 14 year old

439
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,720
with no mother and a
traveling father that meant...

440
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,160
... sex...

441
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,040
... drugs...

442
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:54,040
and bad relationships with
equally destructive men.

443
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:59,600
And I took it all because
I had no self-worth.

444
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:05,760
You don't know, Sartaj,
how empty you really are

445
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,920
until someone knocks you down.

446
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,040
My father used to say...

447
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,520
God is in every particle,
God is everywhere.

448
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,440
Just came in my mind.

449
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,400
Nothing 'just' comes in the mind.

450
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,800
I used to think...

451
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,280
there's no one weaker than my dad.

452
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,760
He had nothing.

453
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:51,640
He was happy accepting
his life as God's pube...

454
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,800
But I turned out to be
even weaker than him.

455
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:59,680
I'm not going to remain weak.

456
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:02,280
What do I have to do?

457
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:11,760
Ganesh you possess a dynamic quality

458
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,320
Great energy...

459
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:19,160
However, energy leads
to self-doubt as well...

460
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,560
you'll have to sacrifice self-doubt.

461
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,800
Do you remember the story of Katch.

462
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:30,560
Ganesh, to conquer death one
needs to die several times.

463
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,104
Guruji said I would be born again

464
00:33:37,105 --> 00:33:40,025
If I chose the right
path at the right time.

465
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,080
Okay.

466
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:46,083
I've organized a Dastangoi

467
00:33:46,084 --> 00:33:47,964
event in Dubai.

468
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,520
Shahid might come.

469
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,960
This is a tale of Muhammad bin Qasim.

470
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,185
Muhammad bin Qasim

471
00:34:06,186 --> 00:34:10,440
the most iconic personalities
in Islamic history.

472
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:15,680
According to Hindustan, Muhammad
bin Qasim is a marauder...

473
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:18,560
A tyrant, who because
of his personal ambition

474
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:23,559
and religious doctrine
attacked Hindustan,

475
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,892
massacred its people and

476
00:34:25,893 --> 00:34:29,448
used violence to spread
Islam through the land.

477
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:34,529
But in Pakistan, countless
people consider Muhammad bin Qasim

478
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,784
to be their community's
supreme leader...

479
00:34:39,785 --> 00:34:42,065
And the Nation's founder.

480
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:48,719
Muhammad Bin Qasim
will unmistakably hold

481
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,424
utmost importance in Pakistan.

482
00:34:50,425 --> 00:34:56,505
He was a warrior who conquered Sindh
and made it an Islamic caliphate.

483
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:02,960
At the age of 17, he captured Sindh

484
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,344
by killing King Dahir...

485
00:35:07,345 --> 00:35:08,785
And informed the world

486
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,424
that an Islamic warrior can go to
any lengths to fulfill his duty.

487
00:35:14,425 --> 00:35:16,728
The masters have taught
us to take the sword

488
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:19,249
And use it for the
revolution of our community...

489
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:22,800
Motherfucker, stop digging your
nose so much. You're in Dubai.

490
00:35:24,366 --> 00:35:28,806
If oil springs up, the Sheikhs
will keep you here. Faggot.

491
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,400
Awesome!

492
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:38,960
And now a comical saga
of the king of fruits - The Mango!

493
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:43,079
Its nectar is sweeter than the
sweetest honey from the heavens.

494
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:48,839
The allure is so strong that even

495
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:53,360
a cripple could climb its
way up a tree to taste it.

496
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:54,880
Awesome!

497
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:06,480
This fruit is the result
of a lover's devotion.

498
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,304
Every story reaches a crossroads

499
00:36:22,305 --> 00:36:24,160
from where it could go anywhere

500
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,160
that junction had arrived in mine.

501
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,440
I had the remote control, not
of the bomb but of my future.

502
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:35,199
If I killed Shahid Khan,
I would live a happy life

503
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,280
but would become Miss Yadav's slave.

504
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:42,320
If I spared him, life would
be like Guruji spoke about

505
00:36:43,053 --> 00:36:44,053
sacrifice,

506
00:36:44,575 --> 00:36:45,959
rebirth,

507
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:47,080
God.

508
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:54,320
In that moment I changed
many destinies, Sardarji.

509
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,560
Shahid Khan's, yours,

510
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,080
and my city, Bombay's...

511
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,680
What happened?

512
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,039
Let's go.

513
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,040
- Miss Yadav...
- Let's go.

514
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:12,000
The next night, I uprooted
myself from Kenya...

515
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:14,720
and from the crusty life I was living.

516
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,000
Harsha.

517
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,560
Harsha.

518
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:51,120
Let's go.

519
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,280
Harsha,

520
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:59,560
our airplane is waiting for us.

521
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
Come.

522
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,440
Harsha!

523
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,759
Harsha!

524
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,599
Mathur, can you stop it please?

525
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:07,304
- I was making coffee.
- It's irritating me a lot.

526
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,485
I think you should stop
fixating about Gaitonde.

527
00:39:09,486 --> 00:39:11,286
I don't give a fuck about Gaitonde.

528
00:39:13,285 --> 00:39:16,365
I've been after Shahid
Khan for the past 11 years.

529
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:20,944
Gaitonde's my asset and I
know how to keep him in-check.

530
00:39:20,945 --> 00:39:22,585
You wait and watch.

531
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,720
- Ma'am, there is a call for you.
- Thank you.

532
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
Hello?

533
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,160
Is this Jamila?

534
00:39:46,615 --> 00:39:48,375
One second please.

535
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,131
Who's this?

536
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:58,132
You want Gaitonde off your back?

537
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,280
Brother,

538
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,880
Bunty's sent something to cheer
you up. It's in the bedroom.

539
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,400
Surprise.

540
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:36,144
You don't think of me these
days. So I came myself.

541
00:40:36,145 --> 00:40:37,265
Why did you come here?

542
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,760
- What do you mean?
- Did you bring her here?

543
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,280
No... Bunty sent her.

544
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,600
Shut the fuck up.

545
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,720
Start packing. We have to leave tonight.

546
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,680
Miss Yadav gave you a call, right?

547
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,200
You told her the location of this place?

548
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,120
We got to pack.

549
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:18,320
Pack?

550
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:22,239
If boss said we got to
pack, then we got to pack.

551
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
Reiko,

552
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,080
light off.

553
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,625
It was all Miss Yadav. I was scared.

554
00:41:57,626 --> 00:42:00,239
His father's a film producer
and promised me a film.

555
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,680
I just did what everyone else does.

556
00:42:04,465 --> 00:42:07,785
Everyday I think you'll
send Bunty to kill me.

557
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,760
I'm sorry. I'll speak to her.

558
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:14,040
She'll agree. Please don't be angry.

559
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,480
Don't be angry! Don't be angry!

560
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:13,240
With my cover blown,

561
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:16,440
and no place to run.

562
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,560
I found myself stranded
at sea once again

563
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,120
but this time...

564
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,640
I wasn't running anywhere.

565
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:30,560
I had killed the coward inside me.

566
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,880
I'm not coming with you guys.

567
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,160
My sacrifice earned me my new home,

568
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,240
with my third father.

569
00:44:44,135 --> 00:44:47,199
It felt as though I was within
the beating heart of a storm.

570
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,960
Enjoying tranquility, while
it raged, on the outside.

571
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,879
Yeah, Kamble, speak.

572
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:15,920
Sir, the truck has been found.
It was carrying the goods.

573
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:22,360
But the license plate seems
fake. No registration papers...

574
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:23,960
Send me a picture.

575
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,720
You've worked extensively
on the Shahid Khan case.

576
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:05,600
He's an ISI spy.

577
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,600
He was involved with the
ISI and in the 1993 blasts.

578
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,760
Did he have any links with Gaitonde?

579
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:14,360
They were both active at the same time.

580
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,080
He's going to be attacking India.

581
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,000
Gaitonde let him go...

582
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,080
Why ma'am?

583
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:26,240
Please try to remember.

584
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:30,960
Nuclear fuel was brought
from Malindi to Mandvi,

585
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,320
and then sent to Mumbai.

586
00:46:35,535 --> 00:46:37,119
We found this truck.

587
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:41,040
Traces of radiation have been found
on it. What is Shahid Khan's plan?

588
00:46:41,920 --> 00:46:44,680
We need a password to reach him.

589
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,839
Please help us ma'am. Please.

590
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:49,480
Shahid Khan was crazy
about colonial history.

591
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,440
He would do everything
according to that.

592
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:57,360
He came on Gabriel.

593
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:00,720
Jibril!

594
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,600
The King of Calicut refused.

595
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,520
Ma'am... Shahid Khan.

596
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:16,880
I told you, Vasco Da Gama came
to India in 1498 to capture it.

597
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,080
There was a vendor

598
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:23,000
from Mandvi...

599
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,080
who dealt in indigo...

600
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,920
Kanji Maalam.

601
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,360
Gabriel...

602
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:43,000
Vasco Da Gama...

603
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:50,120
Maalam...

604
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:55,800
The first attempt at capturing India...

605
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:59,520
Spain and Portugal divided
up the world in two parts.

606
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:04,240
Both were obsessed with
discovering and capturing India.

607
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,920
The Spanish headed west,

608
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,240
thinking they'll come around to India.

609
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:13,120
The Portuguese lost their way.

610
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:20,320
But then they found a Gujarati
trader on the Malindi port in Kenya.

611
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,760
Maalam, a resident of Mandvi.

612
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,920
And they reached here in 1498,

613
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,720
on a ship called Gabriel,

614
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:33,480
from Malindi, with Maalam.

615
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,600
Maalam.

616
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,000
Vasco Da Gama?

617
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:42,600
One second, one second...

618
00:48:43,855 --> 00:48:46,359
We've exhausted all our chances.

619
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,240
We only have one try left.

620
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:12,000
Correct password.

621
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,200
Sir, a number has come.
