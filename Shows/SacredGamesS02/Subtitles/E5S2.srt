8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,320
As-salam alaykum Brother. Aalam here.

9
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:21,600
Okay.

10
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,840
As-salam alaykum Brother. Aalam here.

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,000
Okay.

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,040
As-salam alaykum Brother. Aalam here.

13
00:01:16,255 --> 00:01:17,639
Alaikum-asalaam.

14
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,320
Brother. Aalam here.

15
00:01:19,635 --> 00:01:20,679
Yeah.

16
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,000
Brother, where should
we bring the Kalimiri?

17
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:24,584
Military.

18
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,545
How many kilograms?

19
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,640
He hung up.

20
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,800
Boss...

21
00:01:37,151 --> 00:01:39,311
Brother. Aalam here.

22
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:40,959
Where should we bring the Kalimiri?

23
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,984
Military.

24
00:01:41,985 --> 00:01:43,185
How many kilograms?

25
00:01:45,495 --> 00:01:47,719
By 'Military' he means Military Cafe.

26
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:50,160
He'll reveal the rest
of the details later.

27
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,280
Good Job. Beautiful.

28
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,360
Made Taj Mahal out of it.

29
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Take this.

30
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,720
Let me know if you need more.

31
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,080
We'll get it sent to your homes.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,555
It's said that Shahjahan

33
00:02:09,556 --> 00:02:10,904
desired to make another Taj Mahal

34
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,345
in front of the existing one.

35
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,800
Using black marble.

36
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,440
But he couldn't get it made...

37
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:21,520
Because the workers'
hands had been cut off.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:24,184
Sometimes they ought to be cut.

39
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,280
Good!

40
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
Where are you from?

41
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:35,720
I'm from Himachal.

42
00:03:43,865 --> 00:03:44,865
Okay.

43
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,240
You take off.

44
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
I'll call you.

45
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,840
You're still living the same life.

46
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,984
Earlier you'd wear a burqa
while going to work in jail,

47
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:08,265
and today as well you've
come wearing a burqa.

48
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,504
Ma'am... please save me.

49
00:04:10,505 --> 00:04:11,585
Ma'am?

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,360
Doesn't seem right
coming out of your mouth.

51
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Jojo...

52
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,880
... Gaitonde will kill me.

53
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,920
You wanted to grow wings
and reach for the sky.

54
00:04:26,412 --> 00:04:28,556
Now that you've flown near the sun,

55
00:04:28,557 --> 00:04:30,357
you're afraid of being burnt.

56
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:31,960
I was scared.

57
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,720
He made you an actress.

58
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,840
Today you are a sensation.

59
00:04:39,815 --> 00:04:41,999
Why did you want to fly
next to the sun then?

60
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,880
Well, even he thinks he's God.

61
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,024
Just because he made me an
actress, he thinks he owns me.

62
00:04:48,025 --> 00:04:50,145
That, I'll go to him
whenever he wants me.

63
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,920
- Even I have some reputation.
- Reputation? Seriously?

64
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,920
One call of his gets you shook.

65
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Will you help me?

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
Why? Won't 'they' help you?

67
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,640
The ones you helped...

68
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,760
in killing Gaitonde.

69
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,520
They didn't kill...

70
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,640
What help do you want?

71
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,240
This...

72
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,879
What's this?

73
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,200
Jameela's passport.

74
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,520
All documents.

75
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,680
My entire previous life.

76
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,799
You remember your previous life?

77
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,120
In case I ever need it...

78
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,600
Just like you couldn't

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,600
rid of your previous life.

80
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:47,360
Still have kept Mary's picture.

81
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,840
There's always

82
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:52,280
plenty of gossip in the industry...

83
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,840
In the magazines,

84
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,960
blind articles...

85
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,480
But internally everyone knows...

86
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:01,920
The launch party...

87
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,160
Mary's...

88
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,159
Her film...

89
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,839
Before her film launch
on the roof... she...

90
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:08,920
Jameela!

91
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,360
You had a meeting today?
With... Manu... Manu Gaba?

92
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,599
It happened.

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,279
- How was it?
- Superb.

94
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,119
- Yeah?
- He'll give me a film,

95
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,440
if I take off my clothes.

96
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,400
The day we become big actors,

97
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,160
we're going to take all
these asshole's clothes off.

98
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,679
And if we don't big actors?

99
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:34,920
You certainly will.

100
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,720
Your looks are enchanting!

101
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,680
- Really?
- Really.

102
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,079
And my grace?

103
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,360
It's exquisite.

104
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
Just for that, Mary's special
noodles only for my Jojo.

105
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:50,680
My dearest Mary, surprise!

106
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,520
- What's this?
- Open it.

107
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,879
Wow! This is the same
bracelet that actress wears.

108
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,040
Thank you!

109
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,240
Go. Get out of here.

110
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,720
You had betrayed Mary...

111
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,040
Don't do the same to me

112
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,959
Bunty?

113
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:39,080
Sent him three girls
dressed up as dominatrix.

114
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
Only then he gave your number.

115
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,559
He said you're out of India
somewhere in the Ashram.

116
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,320
Don't tell me you've become a monk.

117
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,520
The penance I went through for you...

118
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,600
But you were still out of my reach...

119
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:53,959
What could I do?

120
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:56,559
Will you return from your
pilgrimage, if I come to you?

121
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,280
India's flushed out an order to
all countries to shoot me on sight.

122
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,240
This life of the
ascetic is all I got now.

123
00:08:09,954 --> 00:08:11,298
Let Jameela off the hook.

124
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:14,059
She didn't know the shit
she was getting herself into.

125
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,300
Alright, she's off the hook.

126
00:08:17,957 --> 00:08:19,197
Seriously? Easy as that?

127
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,800
You asked me that's enough.

128
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:26,520
By the way why you
defending her so much?

129
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,680
Repaying a debt...

130
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,520
Had betrayed someone.

131
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:33,200
Who?

132
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,760
Why do you want to know?

133
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:39,159
You've become a monk right?
Focus there. I've got some work.

134
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,344
Listen, listen...

135
00:08:40,345 --> 00:08:41,504
Huh?

136
00:08:42,062 --> 00:08:43,782
Cuss at me, for the last time.

137
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,120
Call me a faggot.

138
00:08:47,478 --> 00:08:48,678
Why 'last time'?

139
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,520
Are you dying for real?

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
Who knows when this pilgrimage will end?

141
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,040
Will I get to speak to you again...

142
00:08:57,574 --> 00:08:58,639
... I don't know.

143
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,960
You and your theatrics.

144
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:03,279
Come to Mumbai, I'll make you an actor.

145
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,875
And why won't we speak again?

146
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:06,744
I have your number,
I'm going to call you.

147
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,240
I won't receive

148
00:09:08,935 --> 00:09:10,479
- your call.
- Really?

149
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,560
Even your daddy's going to
come! I'm hanging up now. Bye.

150
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,520
Faggot.

151
00:09:27,602 --> 00:09:31,802
After I left, Miss Yadav
had you by the balls, right?

152
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,440
As soon as you left, I escaped as well.

153
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,280
When was the first
time you met Miss Yadav?

154
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,000
She loves her country.

155
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:46,319
So...

156
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,719
She got me to work as well,

157
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,560
for the sake of the country.

158
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,624
Don't you love... the country?

159
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,625
I do, indeed.

160
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:59,680
Although, her understanding of
the country and mine are different.

161
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,360
For her, country means

162
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,480
what it is in the present

163
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,960
and what it will be in the future.

164
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,520
But for us, country means

165
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,440
what it was in the past,

166
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,440
what it could have been today.

167
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,560
And it definitely shall become!

168
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,080
What shall it become?

169
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,840
Satya-Yuga...

170
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:28,240
Vedic Times.

171
00:10:29,619 --> 00:10:33,123
All Ashram life revolved around
the Satya Yuga scam.

172
00:10:33,124 --> 00:10:35,804
To enter Satya Yuga,
sacrifice was required.

173
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,080
Troubles, pains, hunger
were all forms of sacrifice.

174
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,744
Even during winters, the
motherfuckers didn't give a blanket.

175
00:10:44,745 --> 00:10:48,545
Food was plenty, but not edible.

176
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,264
Yet, everyone was cool with it because

177
00:10:53,265 --> 00:10:55,769
they would always get

178
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,610
free Gochi - the world's best drug.

179
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,640
I had slowly started understanding
what Guruji spoke about.

180
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:16,120
Guruji was writing a book
related to Satya Yuga

181
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,320
and said he'd reveal
everything at the right time.

182
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:25,720
One needed to be pure
to enter Satya Yuga,

183
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,904
Guruji would test that by his dice game.

184
00:11:30,905 --> 00:11:32,025
Four.

185
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,544
To be proved pure, the
dice needed to show a four,

186
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,608
which would never happen for me.

187
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:39,791
Two.

188
00:11:39,792 --> 00:11:40,952
Still, Dynamic.

189
00:11:49,495 --> 00:11:52,359
There were many ways
to make one's self pure.

190
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:55,240
One was controlling pain.

191
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,560
The other was screaming out the anger.

192
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,560
Another was stashing away your lust.

193
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,000
We consider sex as a type of hunger.

194
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,400
It has a need...

195
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,200
it has a craving in it.

196
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,840
There is need to breath as well,

197
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,680
but it doesn't have
craving or violence it.

198
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,480
We need to make sex

199
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,280
as simple as breathing.

200
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,080
Make love to the soul.

201
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,320
Sex is nothing,

202
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,400
but the exchange of energy

203
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:43,240
Make it like an exercise

204
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,160
and it will make you pure.

205
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,904
In that lust and Gochi meeting

206
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:54,905
I saw Batya properly for the first time,

207
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,240
She was closest to Guruji.

208
00:12:57,573 --> 00:12:59,956
And I wanted to replace her.

209
00:12:59,957 --> 00:13:00,957
Gaitonde.

210
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,679
Who knows about our drug route?

211
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,680
Nobody knows.

212
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:09,840
Don't lie.

213
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,480
Our consignments are getting seized.

214
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,760
Maybe...

215
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,200
Miss Yadav.

216
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,600
Maybe?

217
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:23,079
- Huh.
- Huh?

218
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,744
I had felt hatred many times before,

219
00:13:25,745 --> 00:13:27,808
but I felt jealousy for the first time.

220
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:32,669
The connection I felt with Guruji,
I had not felt with anyone before.

221
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:39,111
Not with mom, dad, Kukoo,
nor Subhadra, with nobody.

222
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,080
But Guruji felt that
way only with Batya.

223
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,680
I've thought of a name for this...

224
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,040
Kaal Granth.

225
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,480
Don't!

226
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,480
Only once we enter Satya-Yuga.

227
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,520
When will we enter it?

228
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:10,800
"Have patience O heart".

229
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
We will, shortly.

230
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,600
And this book...

231
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:20,800
... will be the last Guru of that world.

232
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:36,680
With your right hand, on the right side.

233
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,159
We need to keep a very
keen eye on everything.

234
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,799
According to our intel.
Mumbai is the likely target.

235
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,360
The truck drivers who had come in
with the supply have been caught.

236
00:15:00,695 --> 00:15:01,839
What's in the truck?

237
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:03,280
- Nothing, Sir.
- Show me.

238
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,999
Come.

239
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,444
Stop you motherfucker.

240
00:15:07,445 --> 00:15:09,349
Octroi has revealed...

241
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,013
these trucks have been
coming for the past 3 years.

242
00:15:12,014 --> 00:15:15,037
We've found a lead where the
goods dropped by the truckers.

243
00:15:15,038 --> 00:15:16,701
We have made a sketch too

244
00:15:16,702 --> 00:15:20,166
We're assuming that this Harun
Bilal, Shahid's second in command.

245
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:23,047
We need to secure other
places of national interest.

246
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,544
Financial hubs, tourist
attractions, religious sites etc.

247
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:29,689
are being secured by the forces.

248
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,314
All the cash from the RBI
vault is being relocated.

249
00:15:32,315 --> 00:15:35,035
Central oil companies'
fuel is being transported.

250
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,640
Take the pill, Sardarji.

251
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,600
Else, the hand won't stop shaking.

252
00:15:50,055 --> 00:15:51,055
Coming up, Sir.

253
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,520
- Now...
- Sir.

254
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,560
- Are you ok?
- Yes, Sir.

255
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,064
Sir, if I can get 5
minutes with Bhonsle?

256
00:15:59,065 --> 00:16:00,208
Not possible.

257
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,312
Sir, there is a connection
between Hizbuddin and the ashram.

258
00:16:03,313 --> 00:16:04,433
That's what you think.

259
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,560
What about the trucks?

260
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,280
Someone's behind letting them through.

261
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,704
Will see.

262
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:16,008
Only four days remain
according to your investigation.

263
00:16:16,009 --> 00:16:18,129
Or it could be less, what do you think?

264
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,080
Our evacuation plan is ready.

265
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:25,199
We can intermittently
cancel all flights zonally,

266
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:29,560
and use those aircrafts for
evacuation in Maharashtra.

267
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,439
What if we use local and express trains?

268
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:35,240
Two to 2.2 million people
can be evacuated in a day.

269
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:39,640
Ma'am we have asked the RTO for a
list of all the available vehicles.

270
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:44,000
Incoming traffic from
other cities will be barred.

271
00:16:44,735 --> 00:16:46,959
All highway lanes will
have one-way traffic.

272
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,320
The BSF vehicles are also on stand-by.

273
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,520
Your phone call would always
result in one thing at our house...

274
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,400
a fight!

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,280
He would just drop everything,
his wife, kids, everything

276
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:30,280
and run after you.

277
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I've come to speak to you about Rohit.

278
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,079
He doesn't come home. Just
sleeps in the nearby temple

279
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,240
or at a friend's place.

280
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,200
My son has definitely got wrong company.

281
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,680
I had met him.

282
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,960
Tried to make him understand,
but he's very angry.

283
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,560
And he has a right to be...

284
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,160
and you must be well.

285
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,000
I couldn't save him.

286
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,160
I'll make him understand.

287
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,960
Don't worry.

288
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,040
- I'm going.
- Hold on.

289
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:08,160
Keep this.

290
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,880
- No.
- Please.

291
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,800
Yes, Sir...

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,280
Sir, have you ever seen them?

293
00:20:17,137 --> 00:20:18,857
You had said you would co-operate.

294
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,200
And I'm here.

295
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Hmm?

296
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:17,979
Four-five minutes is all you have.

297
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,560
Joseph Sir, has asked
you to try as well.

298
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,200
Come.

299
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:30,040
We have got an hour. Let's
see what Sartaj can do.

300
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,920
Have things gotten so bad

301
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,680
that they've sent you?

302
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,720
- Audible?
- Yeah.

303
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,600
October 1996 was the first
time you went to Croatia

304
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,120
to Guruji's Ashram.

305
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,280
What did you say?

306
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,384
October 1996 was the first
time you went to Croatia...

307
00:22:20,385 --> 00:22:21,768
Hey, Sartaj!

308
00:22:21,769 --> 00:22:25,032
What does that have to do with
this case? Stop talking nonsense.

309
00:22:25,033 --> 00:22:29,393
Between 2005 and 2015, the work
done by Gaitonde for the Ashram,

310
00:22:31,535 --> 00:22:33,279
Import and Export...

311
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,880
Who gave the permissions
and sanctions for that?

312
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,040
What is this?

313
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,400
Guruji's close-knit circle
had 10 to 12 people...

314
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:50,760
You and Gaitonde were
also a part of that...

315
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,360
Gaitonde used to send trucks
full of stuff from Mandvi.

316
00:22:54,628 --> 00:22:56,620
Someone high up let
those trucks cross borders

317
00:22:56,621 --> 00:22:58,572
from Gujarat to Maharashtra.

318
00:23:00,151 --> 00:23:01,695
Did you give the permission?

319
00:23:01,696 --> 00:23:07,340
Sartaj, I don't have
time for this crap...

320
00:23:07,341 --> 00:23:09,061
There's still 2 minutes left, Sir.

321
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,960
Take 'em up your ass.

322
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,680
Speak up.

323
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,119
- Oh, shit!
- What's your connection to Ganesh Gaitonde

324
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:19,960
Are you drunk, motherfucker?

325
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,719
Leave me, motherfucker!

326
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,944
How does the motherfucker
have the audacity to touch me?

327
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:27,465
Bhonsle knows something.

328
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:36,719
Sir.

329
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:38,359
Are you out of your mind?

330
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:41,439
I don't know how did he managed
to stay in your department.

331
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,760
He barely managed, Sir.

332
00:23:43,415 --> 00:23:46,039
I'll go to Bhonsle's house to apologize.

333
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:49,640
Yes, please. We don't want him
calling the press and talking rubbish.

334
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:51,120
Let me handle this.

335
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:03,240
Illegal drug traces have been
found in your blood stream.

336
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,240
You're suspended from the SIT.

337
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,360
Sir...

338
00:24:10,108 --> 00:24:12,028
Majid, keep an eye on him.

339
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,880
Sir, one second... Sir.

340
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,280
Sir, I think Sartaj was asking
Bhonsle about the trucks.

341
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,360
- So?
- Sir, I've also received a tip.

342
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:28,799
that an insider is involved in
giving clearance for the trucks.

343
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,920
Who?

344
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,720
Don't know, Sir.

345
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:54,520
I listened to your
advice I found a Guru.

346
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,160
Wish you luck.

347
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:02,720
What did you say at
home while coming here?

348
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,520
Nasik.

349
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
You...

350
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,440
Why did you choose him in
particular? Why not any other Guru?

351
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,240
Do you know of Vikarna?

352
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
If he's some local don, then yes.

353
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,519
When Draupadi was getting raped,

354
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,840
Vikarna was the only man to protest.

355
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,720
Our Guruji is just like him.

356
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:33,424
The entire world is on
the verge of destruction,

357
00:25:33,425 --> 00:25:35,448
and only Guruji is speaking the truth.

358
00:25:35,449 --> 00:25:36,929
KAL GRANTHA

359
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:46,080
Speak to us O' Earth, this
throne is feeling the dearth.

360
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,153
There was a time when every king

361
00:25:50,154 --> 00:25:52,184
would have certain people in his court,

362
00:25:53,375 --> 00:25:56,519
who would spend all day having
their ears touching the earth

363
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,879
and would be able to
detect horses footsteps

364
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,800
of the enemy's army even
a hundred miles away.

365
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,280
Today, the earth is speaking up again.

366
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,120
The soldiers of darkness, are
quickly approaching on horseback.

367
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:21,080
The time has come to elect a commander

368
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:24,560
that can hear the horses
footsteps of the approaching enemy.

369
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,480
This someone must not be
blinded by the darkness.

370
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,440
Ganesh,

371
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
take us into Satya-Yuga.

372
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,879
Two years later when Guruji made me

373
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,399
of the Satya-Yuga Project,

374
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:54,200
I thought he loved me as well.

375
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:06,000
What are you doing, Guruji?

376
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,320
Worshipping your purity.

377
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,240
Slowly I earned Guruji's love

378
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:20,160
and Batya's place.

379
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:25,024
Today, your life of
purity begins, Ganesh.

380
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:27,470
If I'd known that day what Satya Yuga

381
00:27:27,471 --> 00:27:29,440
had planned for my future

382
00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:33,099
I would have fucking burned
that monk's outfit right there.

383
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,760
I shouldn't get a call
from the Dean. Understood?

384
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:45,119
Yes, I'll tell her.

385
00:27:48,409 --> 00:27:50,049
- Anjali?
- Yeah.

386
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:52,840
She's getting totally out of hand.

387
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,024
She stole mangoes from
the Dean's orchard.

388
00:27:56,025 --> 00:27:57,065
Well?

389
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,480
Girls who play rough now,

390
00:28:04,655 --> 00:28:06,799
won't get roughed up
when they're grown up.

391
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
Huh?

392
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:15,360
Listen, you can catch
Gaitonde in the morning.

393
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,280
Let's go to bed.

394
00:28:19,640 --> 00:28:20,640
Come on.

395
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,720
What is it now?

396
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:40,600
Huh?

397
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:43,920
You didn't get enough of
me already, the entire day?

398
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,159
Now more questions?

399
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,720
I've come to apologize.

400
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,520
Then, apologize.

401
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:04,040
I apologize... On the
department's behalf as well.

402
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,560
Parulikar,

403
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:09,400
I've been playing

404
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,639
this game for 25 years.

405
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,720
How many years?

406
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
Twenty Five.

407
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:18,344
don't teach your daddy how to fuck.

408
00:31:18,345 --> 00:31:19,345
Leave now.

409
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,680
Leave!

410
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,239
Joseph gave you Bhonsle and you...

411
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,784
Only two more minutes I
would've got it out of him.

412
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:29,745
You would've got two minutes
if you weren't taking dope.

413
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,920
It's not dope.

414
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,760
What was it then?

415
00:31:34,787 --> 00:31:36,547
You got something from the Ashram?

416
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,900
What's the news on Shahid?

417
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,480
Just got an update.

418
00:31:44,735 --> 00:31:46,615
We've been told to stay in this area.

419
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:50,640
He'll let us know the timing. Our
team is waiting at Military Cafe.

420
00:32:07,280 --> 00:32:08,640
I'm not sure,

421
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,720
but Parulkar might have given
clearance for the truck...

422
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:18,600
that came from Kutch...

423
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,800
How do you know?

424
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,400
I just know it was someone
from our department.

425
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,720
In our force, there's not
a bigger bastard than him.

426
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:32,560
Did you tell Joseph?

427
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:36,240
There's no proof.

428
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,400
but I hinted at it.

429
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,400
Parulkar's a bastard. Why do
you play on his side so much?

430
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,960
To hide my name.

431
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,627
It's much more beneficial to be known

432
00:32:53,628 --> 00:32:55,784
as Parulkar's man, than Majid Khan.

433
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,160
Yeah...

434
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,680
Did Shahid call?

435
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,960
Yeah, I'm coming.

436
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,360
Stay here.

437
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,499
Sir, I'm in position.

438
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,619
Copy.

439
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,060
Go speak to the owner.

440
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:43,283
Guruji had made me the commander,

441
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:47,560
at the time, I had no idea why.

442
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:50,080
I found out after 3 years

443
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:53,399
It was my duty to keep an eye on Bombay,

444
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,279
after coming to the ashram I
had become slightly drowsy.

445
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,720
But that day, Guruji planned
on shaking everyone up.

446
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,440
The world was about to change again.

447
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,800
This is Satya-Yuga...
and this is Kali-Yuga.

448
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:36,960
We need to go from Kali-Yuga
into Satya-Yuga.

449
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,800
Batya.

450
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,560
The journey is long...

451
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,880
It'll take some time. How will we go?

452
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:57,440
The earth is dying with
the burden of our weight

453
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,720
The cancer has metastasized.

454
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:08,600
Our lack of humanity
is bleeding us dead,

455
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,000
by a million cuts every day.

456
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:18,600
Who here doesn't get the
thought at least once a day...

457
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,560
that it'd be better if this world
ends today rather than tomorrow.

458
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,258
However, there is a way out,

459
00:36:28,259 --> 00:36:30,800
which in scientific terms
is called a wormhole.

460
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:34,768
Time and space can be bent

461
00:36:34,769 --> 00:36:38,824
to reach from one end
to the other in a flash.

462
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:45,400
Kali-Yuga is slow death.

463
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,440
We need to speed up this process.

464
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,720
We need to make sacrifice.

465
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,960
Are you people ready for sacrifice?

466
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,424
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

467
00:37:04,425 --> 00:37:06,225
Yes!

468
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:08,240
Ganesh?

469
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Yes!

470
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:12,080
I'm ready.

471
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,280
You work for Shahid Khan?

472
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:58,400
It's not necessary that every
question has just one answer.

473
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,760
Gaitonde and Guruji's connection...

474
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,184
Yours and Batya's connection...

475
00:39:05,185 --> 00:39:07,345
Dilbagh Singh and Ashram's connection...

476
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,720
What is the meaning of all this?

477
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:19,544
Gaitonde dying in front of
you wasn't a coincidence,

478
00:39:19,545 --> 00:39:20,649
but destiny.

479
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:23,210
The two of us meeting here
isn't chance, but fate.

480
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,480
The stars have chosen you to
succeed where Gaitonde failed.

481
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,041
You will find all the
answers you desire,

482
00:39:32,042 --> 00:39:34,440
by following the
footsteps of your father.

483
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:39,680
All life on earth was
born from a single cell.

484
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,996
Over time as this cell mutated,

485
00:39:44,997 --> 00:39:47,000
it gave birth to new organisms.

486
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,384
All it needed was a small
push in the right direction.

487
00:39:52,385 --> 00:39:54,345
To cause the creation of a new being.

488
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,200
There exist three important
historical conflicts in the world.

489
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,880
South and North Korea...

490
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:10,600
Second, Israel and Palestine...

491
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,960
Third, the biggest one

492
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,040
India and Pakistan.

493
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:21,280
They have been at war for over 70 years.

494
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:29,040
And this is not a war
of religion or nations...

495
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,680
This is a war of civilization.

496
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:36,040
We have the next 9 years

497
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,360
to push this world into
the next stage of evolution.

498
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:47,240
The world will remain
unstable for the next 9 years.

499
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,555
There will be financial
difficulties in America,

500
00:40:50,556 --> 00:40:52,744
discord in the Arab world...

501
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,880
New dictators will rise
to power around the globe.

502
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,662
The people from the
first-world countries

503
00:41:00,663 --> 00:41:02,840
will fight over global warming.

504
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:07,680
The Earth beneath us all,
is ridden with waiting mines.

505
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:13,200
One small step in the wrong
direction will cause calamity.

506
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:19,424
All we need to do is set one off

507
00:41:19,425 --> 00:41:25,405
between the borders
of Pakistan and India.

508
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,600
Which will cause an explosion so big,

509
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,680
The flames will lure
everyone else in the fire.

510
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,080
If any of you wishes to leave
this Satya-Yuga project

511
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,280
is free to do so.

512
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,720
My love for you will always remain...

513
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,400
You can go.

514
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,480
Do you remember what we
spoke about Sacrifice?

515
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:41,520
The time has come for another sacrifice.

516
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:09,080
A new man will be born
with this new world

517
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,800
with the sole purpose...

518
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:20,319
of achieving the peace and truth

519
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:23,320
of our ancestor the first single cell.

520
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:28,840
Time the master of
the universe and life,

521
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:34,560
omnipresent like nuclear
energy and ever consuming

522
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,960
We will capture and control time...

523
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,200
with a nuclear blast.

524
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:51,920
Precisely 9 years from today,
there will be a nuclear blast...

525
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,440
And we shall return to the
nucleus that first created us.
