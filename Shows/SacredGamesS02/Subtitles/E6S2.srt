1
00:00:17,935 --> 00:00:19,519
Aham Brahmasmi.

2
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,864
Sir, where are you going?
You can't just enter li...

3
00:00:22,865 --> 00:00:24,585
Get back.

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:27,160
Sir, where are you going? Sir?

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,040
Aham Brahmasmi...

6
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,840
Guruji is alive.

7
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,920
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.

8
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,920
Gaitonde had warned me

9
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,000
that his third father is
about to do something big.

10
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,720
Are you ready for the truth?

11
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,960
Follow me.

12
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,000
You'll understand everything.

13
00:01:57,495 --> 00:01:59,719
He had been dead before I got there.

14
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,144
Looks like a clear suicide,
We're waiting for forensics.

15
00:02:03,145 --> 00:02:06,105
So Malcolm who was dealing
in weapons with Gaitonde

16
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,920
is Shahid's proxy?

17
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,344
Hizbuddin has a history
of utilizing mercenaries.

18
00:02:11,345 --> 00:02:13,193
Malcolm Murad has been a part of

19
00:02:13,194 --> 00:02:15,153
almost every terror organization,

20
00:02:15,154 --> 00:02:16,178
in Asia and Europe.

21
00:02:16,179 --> 00:02:18,219
This looks like more than that.

22
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,704
Gaitonde... had Hizbuddin's
flyer hidden in it.

23
00:02:23,705 --> 00:02:27,449
And his Guru that
Sartaj was talking about?

24
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,610
Sir, there's definitely a link
between the Ashram and Hizbuddin.

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,000
Contact Sartaj and tell
him I want to speak to him.

26
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:37,920
Take one.

27
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,080
It'll help you understand better.

28
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,720
You're not on duty.

29
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,640
Since when do you know I'm a cop?

30
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
All along.

31
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,800
Have it.

32
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,960
Otherwise this discomfort
will become paranoia.

33
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,480
What I'm about to tell you

34
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,920
is beyond the grasp
of your understanding.

35
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,120
Try to keep an open mind.

36
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,839
The plan is simple.

37
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,639
For the next 9 years,

38
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,640
you must focus solely on
increasing the suffering

39
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,960
by taking advantage of
the world's weaknesses.

40
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:41,440
From global warming

41
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,000
to the religious
propaganda on the internet.

42
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,367
Our fellow human beings are bent upon

43
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:52,784
unknowingly destroying this world.

44
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,920
Pakistan will attack India, and
get destroyed in retaliation.

45
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,800
China won't sit silently and
spectate. Neither will Russia.

46
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,960
Nor the USA.

47
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:12,080
They will begin attacking each
other like a bunch of mad dogs.

48
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,800
Their fight

49
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:23,800
will result in the end of mankind.

50
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:27,760
The earth's temperature
will fall rapidly.

51
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,800
Pushing the planet into a nuclear winter

52
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:38,400
while we watch safely
in our special bunkers.

53
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,520
We shall wait in those bunkers
and wait for our penance,

54
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:49,200
sacrifice, patience and truth's power

55
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:56,280
to take us into Satya Yuga.

56
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,744
You people are insane. Deranged.

57
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,485
It's the world that's gone mad, Sartaj.

58
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,320
It's a lie.

59
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,599
How can you destroy this world?

60
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,160
It's not us, the world
is destroying itself.

61
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,104
We are just a catalyst.

62
00:05:19,105 --> 00:05:20,625
Look around you.

63
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,784
Earthquakes, tsunamis, global warming.

64
00:05:24,785 --> 00:05:27,488
They're all signs from this earth.

65
00:05:27,489 --> 00:05:30,752
What kind of world are
you trying to save, Sartaj?

66
00:05:30,753 --> 00:05:34,313
When 3-year old children are getting
raped in the name of religion?

67
00:05:34,735 --> 00:05:37,759
What's there in this
world that should be saved?

68
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,344
Do you have even one
reason to save the world?

69
00:05:40,345 --> 00:05:42,345
Nobody will believe all this.

70
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:45,240
Dilbagh Singh believed in it.

71
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,480
This photo was taken on the day
Guruji revealed his vision to us.

72
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,870
Join us Sartaj. Finish
what your father started.

73
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:55,653
I told Guruji that

74
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,354
Shahid is beating a drum in the street,

75
00:06:58,355 --> 00:06:59,784
begging for money to destroy India

76
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,639
Malcolm claiming to be
India's enemy met Shahid

77
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,760
and gave him money to
fulfill his insane desires.

78
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,480
Whether it's the Afghan
war or the war on India,

79
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,680
ISI has a bad habit.

80
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:19,200
They set flames to their surroundings
while hiding in the shadows.

81
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:21,879
The time is now to attack like bandits,

82
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:24,104
but they behave like petty pickpockets.

83
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:25,665
Not everyone has the courage.

84
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,960
You are right.

85
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,199
In 1947, the courage and character
Mohammad Ali Jinnah showed,

86
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:34,800
has vanished from today's world.

87
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,880
Looking at you one
can't be accused of that.

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,304
If one fights to the end,
he will surely perish, but...

89
00:07:43,305 --> 00:07:45,865
But he will light a
candle of revolution.

90
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,720
Beautiful.

91
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,760
Just keep in mind

92
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,720
we can't turn back now.

93
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:58,679
- Think carefully before you join us.
- There's nothing to think.

94
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,920
It's Allah's will.

95
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:02,639
We are merely vessels.

96
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,080
I've spoken to Shahid. He's ready.

97
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,159
We just need to provide
him with nuclear fuel

98
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,519
and a place for assembly.
He'll do the rest.

99
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,839
Guruji's idea of ending the world

100
00:08:13,985 --> 00:08:18,105
by adding fuel to the world's
flaming problems was a masterstroke.

101
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,984
There was huge crisis
in the Middle East.

102
00:08:22,985 --> 00:08:26,129
We gave weapons t o those people.

103
00:08:27,395 --> 00:08:30,154
The one's who didn't
die, became homeless.

104
00:08:30,765 --> 00:08:33,525
The Americans were angry
because of the recession.

105
00:08:34,040 --> 00:08:37,680
We gave them guns to vent their anger.

106
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:41,496
Guruji said he'd conquer
darkness with darkness.

107
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,200
his world had to sacrifice itself.

108
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,200
Now, the book Guruji had been
writing for the past 20 years,

109
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,400
was finally finished.

110
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,800
This book would teach us the
way to live in Satya Yuga.

111
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,960
They were the best days of my life.

112
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,360
Guruji made me believe
that I was special

113
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:14,240
and I would be the God of
the upcoming Satya Yuga.

114
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,920
And I believed everything he said.

115
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,160
Ganesh, I am going

116
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,920
into samadhi,

117
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,760
away from this life.

118
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,080
A millennium of darkness
needs to be vanquished...

119
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:37,800
And that requires immense
penance and purity.

120
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,440
I have to leave

121
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,680
But we will meet soon....

122
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,520
In Satya Yuga.

123
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:03,519
We will meet soon...

124
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,280
Guruji faked his death to the world.

125
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,280
So he could remain in monastic penance.

126
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,439
Strength and sacrifice were
needed to enter Satya Yuga.

127
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,320
Guruji would provide the
strength, and I would sacrifice.

128
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:32,120
I had to finish the job
with that bitch Batya.

129
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,304
I used to really miss Guruji.

130
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:42,948
I really wished for this world to end,

131
00:10:42,949 --> 00:10:45,171
I really wished for this world to end,

132
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,639
When I was exiled 12 years ago,

133
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,999
I had thought I made all
the needed sacrifices.

134
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,399
But little did I know,

135
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,119
the biggest was yet to come,
the sacrifice of Bombay!

136
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:03,200
To make the new world, it
was my job to plan in Bombay.

137
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Batya left the Croatia Ashram

138
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:13,160
and made a team of 100 pure
people to enter the new world.

139
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,000
She brought all of them to Bombay.

140
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:20,039
Bhonsle used his political
influence to buy land worth millions

141
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,919
for pennies.

142
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,024
To build the Ashram in Bombay,

143
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:26,559
We will get every single artifact

144
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,224
that Guruji has worn, has
touched, has blessed...

145
00:11:30,225 --> 00:11:34,264
I planted the false threat
of Pakistan in Bhosle's mind

146
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:41,440
and he provided all his men
with weapons, to spread terror.

147
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:44,424
But the bastard didn't know
what the actual plan was.

148
00:11:44,425 --> 00:11:47,545
There will be more than 1000 tankers...

149
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,400
The trucks Bhonsle
used to smuggle weapons

150
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:54,400
were used for carrying
parts for the nuclear bomb.

151
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,279
My old factory was given to Malcolm

152
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,480
for assembling the
nuclear bomb with Shahid.

153
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,319
While above the ground,
Shahid constructed the bomb.

154
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,639
Under it, Batya began
preparing for the Satyug Project

155
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:11,360
and somewhere in the middle,
my third father remained hidden.

156
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,360
Everything was ready for
the 'Sacrifice of Bombay'.

157
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,199
They have something huge.

158
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:19,559
What do you mean?

159
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,640
I mean something so
dangerous that can...

160
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,600
destroy the world.

161
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,680
C'mon, spit it out?

162
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,800
This city might not survive.

163
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,400
And what do you mean 'they'
have something? Who's 'they'?

164
00:12:50,508 --> 00:12:51,908
Who has something huge?

165
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:01,320
Wait. Joseph has asked
me to talk to you.

166
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,960
Sartaj, Listen to me.

167
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,400
No action will be taken
against you. Come with me.

168
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,759
Tell Joseph about Guruji,
the Ashram and whoever else...

169
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,279
I'll come myself.

170
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,359
Sartaj.

171
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,760
Sir, I would always
bring them up to here.

172
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,120
Have you seen him?

173
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,320
No.

174
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,960
- Have you seen him?
- No, Sir.

175
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,759
- Sir...
- Did you find anything?

176
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,600
No, Sir. There's nobody there.

177
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,800
Have you seen him?

178
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,680
Have you seen him?

179
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,920
Mahmud of Ghazni asked Ferdowsi
to write a book in his honor.

180
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,320
Mahmud said he'll pay
Ferdowsi 60,000 Dinar.

181
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,480
But when the book was
completed, he paid him only 200.

182
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,800
Ferdowsi cursed him so much
that Mahmud got malaria and died.

183
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:01,969
- Yeah.
- Boss.

184
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:05,268
Maggots are messing up our meal.

185
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,040
We may need to dump it.

186
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,360
Let's see we haven't found...

187
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:33,320
In teams of two...

188
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,960
The mold suggests

189
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,800
that it can hold about
20-30 of those booster tubes.

190
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,520
And at least 30 kg of fuel.

191
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,839
Joseph, the impact could be massive.

192
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:02,919
How massive?

193
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,938
I'm guessing that they
are aiming at about

194
00:16:05,939 --> 00:16:08,424
80 kilotons of yield.

195
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,280
Hiroshima was... 20.

196
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:26,806
What'll you have Sir?
Scrambled? Poached?

197
00:16:26,807 --> 00:16:28,584
Sunny side up? Gaitonde's special?

198
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:30,864
- The special.
- Right, Sir.

199
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:34,528
Sunil the chef of our old
hangout place didn't recognize me,

200
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:37,449
but he was still using my
name to advertise his joint.

201
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:44,480
The taste of the eggs
was still fireworks.

202
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,399
Fuck, it's still great!

203
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,560
- Hello.
- Bunty.

204
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:59,760
- Who is this?
- I saw your show on TV.

205
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,279
It fucking sucks.

206
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:05,344
Motherfucker. Who is this?

207
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,080
Hello?

208
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,239
- Hello.
- Tell me this.

209
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:21,599
Did they cut off your third leg as well?

210
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:27,839
Motherfucker. Who the fuck are you?

211
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,759
Come face me if you've got the balls.

212
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,840
Or I'll come there to stuff
your asshole with my umbrella.

213
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,720
Tell me the place.

214
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,439
You bring your ass
and I'll bring my belt.

215
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,440
You...

216
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:43,468
Speak up ass-wipe. Tell me the place.

217
00:17:44,435 --> 00:17:45,435
Boss?

218
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,000
Welcome boss. Welcome.

219
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,680
You've returned after 13 years.

220
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:12,080
We are going to celebrate
13 years in one night.

221
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,640
What's this 'welcome'? You've
become quite sophisticated.

222
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,280
I thought you'd be... dead by now.

223
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,960
I'll die only after you, schmuck.

224
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
You remember...

225
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,720
what I had told you, then?

226
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,880
Did you stop thinking from your dick?

227
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
Well...

228
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,120
The blood doesn't flow there anymore.

229
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:05,240
It all keeps riling up in here.

230
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,600
Do you miss Badariya?

231
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,800
Sometimes.

232
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,960
And me?

233
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:19,280
It was your fear that kept me
away from India all these years.

234
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Subhadra?

235
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,720
- Did you miss me?
- Nope.

236
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,920
Never.

237
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,021
Brother, I can't tell you how happy

238
00:19:42,022 --> 00:19:43,759
I'm feeling with you sitting with us.

239
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,520
It's like when I fucked
for the first time.

240
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,840
What about Santa's money?

241
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,040
It seems as if I'm seeing your ghost.

242
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,720
Where were you all these years?

243
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,640
What would have I done
by coming to Bombay.

244
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,600
God has forbidden you
from fooling around.

245
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,240
What happened?

246
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,280
I had a younger sister, Mary.

247
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:04,120
Mary fell in real love with
Sameer, the producer's son.

248
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:08,240
He promised to launch her as an actress.

249
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,160
He even threw a launch party for her.

250
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,880
For years, Mary and I used
to give auditions together

251
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,920
and would get rejected together.

252
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:26,320
All of a sudden her life
became a Bollywood movie,

253
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:30,880
where she got everything in one
shot. Love, happiness, and a lead role

254
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,160
It made me jealous.

255
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,160
Oh, sorry! I'm sorry!

256
00:22:20,825 --> 00:22:21,825
Mary!

257
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Mary!

258
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,000
Mary!

259
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,200
Mary!

260
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Mary!

261
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,400
Are you crazy?

262
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,799
How much longer are you going
punish yourself for this?

263
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,199
If I thought like you, I would
have died a thousand times already.

264
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,000
It's different with you.

265
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,160
You kill to save yourself.

266
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,800
Whom did I save by killing?

267
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,600
Whom did I save by killing my sister?

268
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,320
I fucked up so bad...

269
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:30,920
to get a shitty role
that it cost me my sister.

270
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,800
I was an idiot.

271
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:35,760
Let it go.

272
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,520
She comes and sits in
front me of everyday.

273
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,440
Look there, she's here.

274
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,440
"Ok, I'm sorry bitch."

275
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,280
What else do you want?

276
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,680
This city of Bombay gave me everything.

277
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:56,440
From being a waiter I
became the God of Gopalmath.

278
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:00,839
I'm...

279
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:02,894
It then struck me.

280
00:25:02,895 --> 00:25:05,984
Can you give without expectation
of anything in return?

281
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:10,320
What could be purer than that?

282
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
If people could get this,

283
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,144
he whole world's 'darkness'
would finish right away

284
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:18,679
and there wouldn't be a
need for Guruji's plan.

285
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:21,720
The bomb that crashed into
Hiroshima was 15 kiloton.

286
00:25:23,015 --> 00:25:26,679
This one is 120 kiloton.
That's, eight times stronger.

287
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,160
It'll wipe off 800,000
people in the first hour.

288
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,138
Plus, the next 8 generation of Indians

289
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,920
will come out decayed and rotten.

290
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:35,904
Inshallah.

291
00:25:35,905 --> 00:25:37,185
Inshallah.

292
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:44,240
We'll pay off the debts of
1965, 1971, and 1999 in one shot.

293
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,759
Aham Bramhasmi.

294
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,400
I want to speak to Guruji.

295
00:27:11,215 --> 00:27:13,759
Why are you calling on
that line? It's not safe.

296
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,280
Where's Guruji? Do you know?

297
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,384
Gaitonde, you know no one
is allowed to speak to him.

298
00:27:19,385 --> 00:27:22,369
He'll speak to me. I need
to tell him something.

299
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:23,490
Nobody.

300
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:27,563
Tell him it's urgent.
I just saw the bomb.

301
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,480
Motherfucker.

302
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,759
Now, there was only one
way to stop the plan...

303
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:39,880
To stop the money.

304
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,320
Gaitonde? What is all this?

305
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,000
It's your armor.

306
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,400
Armor?

307
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,280
Don't worry. I'll sort everything out.

308
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,200
Yeah, but will you tell
me what needs sorting out?

309
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,600
- What?
- Why aren't you sending the money?

310
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,302
Last payment is also pending.

311
00:28:15,303 --> 00:28:17,624
In Kutch, Aalam is
holding on to the delivery.

312
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,920
- Have me speak to Guruji.
- Guruji's left.

313
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,519
Motherfucker, if you don't
have me speak to Guruji,

314
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,400
I'll piss on his 'New Day Project.'

315
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,320
Gaitonde, don't stop the work.

316
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:32,680
You know I can yank out the
money from your intestine.

317
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:37,160
Can you? Do it then.

318
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,720
Now I had to save myself and the world.

319
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:55,000
Bunty had made a mall which never
opened on Gopalmath's old junkyard.

320
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:58,480
I made a bunker for me underneath it.

321
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,400
to save my ass from
Guruji's runt, Malcolm.

322
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,840
Listen to me. I have decided.

323
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,160
This world is going to stay as is.

324
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,624
I'm going to tell the police.

325
00:29:47,625 --> 00:29:52,145
Tell whoever you want.
Everyone is with us.

326
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,600
Aham Brahmasmi.

327
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,920
Aham Brahmasmi.

328
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,600
Your elephant has gone wild.

329
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:47,880
I told him everyone is with us.

330
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,399
And If he is not having Gochi

331
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,720
he will start to feel
paranoid very soon.

332
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,480
We have time Guruji, but not much.

333
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,279
Whenever some shit has
happened in my life,

334
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:19,024
it's always been because
one of my fathers.

335
00:31:19,025 --> 00:31:21,905
That's just how these
father's are, Sardarji.

336
00:31:46,126 --> 00:31:49,230
Throwing away your dad's
stuff won't do anything,

337
00:31:49,231 --> 00:31:52,854
the more you try to get rid of them,
the more they fuck with your head.

338
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:58,015
Ultimately, I trusted
you to save this city.

339
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:03,719
And you are getting twisted in
Dilbagh Singh's story. Don't.

340
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:06,559
Talk.

341
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:09,984
Sir, we have found Awaiz's
brother, Saad. Please come fast.

342
00:32:09,985 --> 00:32:10,985
I am coming.

343
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:24,504
Now, show us your dance
moves, motherfucker.

344
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:27,649
Move over. You go there, motherfucker.

345
00:32:31,735 --> 00:32:35,159
Get up now, faggot Muslim.

346
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,944
Pick him up.

347
00:32:39,945 --> 00:32:41,849
Pick up the asshole.

348
00:32:41,850 --> 00:32:43,650
Pick him up.

349
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,160
Beat him.

350
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:51,960
Beat him.

351
00:32:59,535 --> 00:33:01,359
Beat him.

352
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:09,720
Give me the tire.

353
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,880
Get up.

354
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,999
Watch me hit a home run.

355
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,840
Give the ball.

356
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,600
Watch this home run.

357
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,400
Watch this fucking home run.

358
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,039
Innings complete.

359
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,640
What's there in this
world that should be saved?

360
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,360
Do you have even one reason?

361
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,120
Sir, no!

362
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,920
Sir, I haven't mentioned you as On-Duty.

363
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,400
Sir.

364
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:59,519
Sir...

365
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,840
Sister, Not right now.

366
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:04,944
Sir, I beg of you.

367
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:08,225
Sir, don't enter Rohit's
name in police records.

368
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,600
It will ruin his life.
