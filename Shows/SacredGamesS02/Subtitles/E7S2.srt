2
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,620
Guruji, where were you?

3
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:55,420
I'm losing my fucking mind here.

4
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,140
It's essential. Ganesh,
every setback is essential.

5
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:00,900
I don't want to do all this.

6
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,460
I am aware.

7
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:05,740
I am also aware of the reason.

8
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,540
Guruji, I understand why
you want to make a new world.

9
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,180
But I don't give two
hoots about the world.

10
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,500
It can end today, for
all I fucking care.

11
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,180
Ganesh, Kaal Granth (Book of Time)
is complete. Do you want to see it?

12
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,780
This country doesn't need
any more fucking books.

13
00:01:20,781 --> 00:01:23,220
Why did you write another one ?

14
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:26,980
Come here.

15
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,940
Time...

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,780
is just like this '8'.

17
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,940
It has no beginning or end.

18
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,540
You are not the first
or the last person,

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,380
to have faced doubts.

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,180
The new world that you want can be
brought about in a different way.

21
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
Tell me

22
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,300
Dynamic? Pure? Dark? A word full
of dicks? Name it and I'll provide.

23
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,860
Just keep Bombay out of this.

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,580
Otherwise I'll rat all
this to the fucking cops.

25
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,380
Wasn't I supposed to be God?

26
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,940
Isn't God supposed to be loving?

27
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,980
Calm down, Ganesh.

28
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,260
Fuck this.

29
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:16,140
A God doesn't hesitate
to accept sacrifice.

30
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,020
Then I'll take Malcom's
head as my first sacrifice.

31
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,740
How dearly you love this dark city...

32
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,580
Whatever you wish will happen, Ganesh...

33
00:02:33,380 --> 00:02:35,980
Today will be the last time
for the 'Lotus position'.

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,980
Leave it whenever you want.

35
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:32,620
Aham Brahmasmi.

36
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:36,660
Aham Brahmasmi.

37
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,620
I am Lord Brahma's dirt.

38
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,380
I am Lord Brahma's dirt.

39
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,540
I love every one.

40
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,660
I love every one.

41
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:51,380
I don't love any one.

42
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:57,820
I don't love any one.

43
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,700
I don't love any one.

44
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,260
I am an Aghori .

45
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:04,980
I am an Aghori.

46
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,940
I can stay alive by eating the dead.

47
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,940
I can stay alive by eating the dead.

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:14,220
I have repeatedly murdered my father.

49
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,980
I have repeatedly murdered my father.

50
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:26,460
I have repeatedly murdered my son.

51
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,980
I have repeatedly murdered my son.

52
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,100
I have repeatedly murdered my wife.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:40,700
I have repeatedly murdered my wife...

54
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,300
I have murdered my mother.

55
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,700
I have murdered my mother.

56
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,860
I am God Kali of Kali Yuga...

57
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,660
I am God Kali of Kali Yuga...

58
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,460
... Son of demons and father of sin...

59
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,500
... Son of demons and father of sin...

60
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:04,140
I am Kalki too, the savior of
Kali and Vishnu's 10th avatar

61
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,020
I am Kalki too.

62
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:08,980
I am supreme.

63
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,700
I am supreme.

64
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,980
I am insignificant.

65
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,860
I am insignificant.

66
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,580
I am gruesome.

67
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,820
I am gruesome.

68
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,380
I am fierce.

69
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,220
I am fierce.

70
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,740
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

71
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:26,180
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

72
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,700
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

73
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,980
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

74
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,580
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

75
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:35,780
- I am Brahma.
- I am Brahma.

76
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:36,940
I am Brahma.

77
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:42,220
Only I am Brahma.

78
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,420
Only I am Brahma.

79
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:50,460
Only I am Brahma.

80
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:57,420
Only I am Brahma.

81
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,260
Only I am...

82
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,500
Only I am Brahma.

83
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,020
We've got the confirmations.

84
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:24,860
Our neighbor has been in
talks with North Korea,

85
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,780
to buy the designs of an
assembled fission device.

86
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,100
Apparently, they've been doing
this for the past 15 years.

87
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:36,700
We've also found out that the
commitments had already been made

88
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:40,900
and the resources had already
started changing hands.

89
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:45,500
You know the atmosphere in Pakistan.

90
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:48,860
The Prime Minister changed,
the Army Chief changed,

91
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:52,620
and then both, Shahid Khan
and Haroon were thrown out.

92
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:56,020
By that time, the alliance of
our enemies was already in place.

93
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,795
So they're getting Shahid

94
00:07:58,796 --> 00:07:59,796
to do everything without
associating themselves?

95
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:02,660
They couldn't have asked
for anything better.

96
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,740
India will be under-attack
and they won't be 'accused'.

97
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,180
What are our options?

98
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,260
We're nearly out of options

99
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,580
The Home Ministry has
ordered the following:

100
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:24,260
the Commissionerate must
be transferred to Nagpur.

101
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:26,660
And you have to start

102
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,260
evacuating Mumbai...

103
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,660
immediately.

104
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,460
You both wait outside.

105
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,060
Jai Hind, sir.

106
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:58,460
Sir, is there any emergency?

107
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:01,260
For how long you been allowing
those trucks to come in?

108
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,020
Sir, I don't follow...

109
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,660
What don't you follow?

110
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,700
If an enquiry happens
you won't be spared.

111
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,380
We need to save this city.

112
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,020
Tell me why those trucks
were coming in to the city.

113
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,180
And if you don't know find out.

114
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,660
That's your only chance
to save yourself now.

115
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,860
Out.

116
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,420
Get out.

117
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,220
Brother...

118
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,140
... Phone.

119
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,740
Hmm.

120
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,340
The trucks you had asked me to bypass...

121
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:12,500
Hmm, you didn't get your cut?

122
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,020
No, call is not about that.

123
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:20,020
What were the trucks carrying?

124
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,540
India's most famous doughnuts.

125
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,220
You ever tried 'em?

126
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:27,180
My dad was the chef there.

127
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,580
It's gotten quite messy.

128
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,180
A top-level, very high-level
enquiry is going on.

129
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,860
My name has also come up in that.

130
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,140
Is this the first time
your name's come up?

131
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:43,980
How is Bhonsle... involved in this?

132
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:46,100
Look, I got no clue.

133
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,500
I owed my friend.

134
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:53,580
He asked me for a favor and
I asked you to get it done.

135
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,780
Which friend?

136
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,500
The one you guys let go in
1993 before coming after me,

137
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,380
forcing me to leave Bombay.

138
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:08,340
You involved me in Shahid Khan's job?

139
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,980
- Sir, a meeting is in progress.
- Wait, sir.

140
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:20,620
- You can't go in.
- Please stop. Sir!

141
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,060
Sir, I asked him to wait.

142
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
Bhonsle Sir,

143
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,780
I need to speak to you
for a couple of minutes.

144
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,460
Let's wait outside

145
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,180
Your mind is a mess, decide now.

146
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:44,060
Bite or let go.

147
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,540
Who spoke to you about granting
the permission for the trucks?

148
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,740
Had Isa called you?

149
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,140
Dubai's Isa?

150
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:02,460
Have you and Sartaj been
sharing a drink together?

151
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:06,500
I know you've been
granting those permissions

152
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:08,140
for the past 3 years.

153
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:12,900
Isa had called me for the last
truck's permission from Dubai.

154
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:17,020
Parulkar, I've no idea
what you're talking about.

155
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:21,300
Everything will be finished in
3 days, destroyed completely.

156
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:25,780
If you can't speak the truth
even while sitting on that chair,

157
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,580
then what's the point of power?

158
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:32,380
The political game you've
been playing for 25 years,

159
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,580
has become bigger than you.

160
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:38,460
They're using use you... and me!

161
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,100
They're using you! I
am of no use to them.

162
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,180
Do you know who Isa works for?

163
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,420
For who?

164
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,940
Shahid Khan.

165
00:12:55,860 --> 00:13:00,100
And I don't need to give
his introduction to you.

166
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,740
Get up, Parulkar.

167
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,940
Get up.

168
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:17,420
Motherfucker, Get out.

169
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,860
Get out.

170
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,540
If I mention your
little game that you're

171
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:25,420
playing with Dubai to any outsider

172
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:28,580
Your uniform will be off and
you'll be suspended in minutes.

173
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:32,420
Your daughter is getting married
to the DG of Police's son,

174
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,260
I'll ensure that doesn't happen.

175
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:39,180
So, don't use your head
unnecessarily. Get out now.

176
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,180
Just remember if my
name comes up anywhere,

177
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:49,380
I'll make sure the world gets
to know what you really are.

178
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:54,820
Get out. Get out.

179
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
Motherfucker.

180
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,380
Guruji.

181
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,700
Nothing will stop

182
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,860
everything is here except one

183
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:34,940
last consignment.

184
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,300
I didn't expect this from Ganesh.

185
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:42,140
That dog's gone wild.
He needs to be put down.

186
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:44,660
First, we need the Kaal
Granth (Book of Time).

187
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:46,860
Time will punish him.

188
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:51,660
This was not the way to go.
This was not the time to go.

189
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,380
You always said,

190
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,420
We choose our journeys ourselves.

191
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,260
We choose our struggles,

192
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:02,940
our purpose, before we
are born on this planet.

193
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,700
Why did you choose this?

194
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,580
Why?

195
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:04,980
Guruji, forgive me.

196
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:08,940
Forgive me, Guruji.

197
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,180
How will you destroy what is inside you?

198
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:21,900
How will you silence the
voice that hasn't reached you?

199
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,580
Shut up, motherfucker.

200
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:29,900
You do not have a choice, but
to listen to this story, Ganesh.

201
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,340
This story sowed the seeds
of Satya Yuga in my life;

202
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:36,860
the story of my parents'
first conjugation.

203
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,900
Do you know, what came first?

204
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:40,980
Amoeba.

205
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,740
One became two.

206
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,060
Like this.

207
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,780
Then, two became four.

208
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:49,820
And four became eight.

209
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:53,620
Gradually, a pyramid was created.

210
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:58,100
If two people, created out
of a single cell amoeba,

211
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:03,580
connect to each other ancestrally
to become a single cell,

212
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,220
that concept is known as

213
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:06,700
a soulmate.

214
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:13,300
It is said that Lord Krishna
had sixteen thousand lovers...

215
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:20,020
But he is worshipped everywhere
only with Goddess Radha.

216
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:22,380
- Why?
- Why?

217
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,500
Soulmate.

218
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,940
It's all a proven science,

219
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,860
not some superstition.

220
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:31,220
Okay, but what are you trying to say?

221
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:36,500
That, if a human being
finds its soulmate,

222
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,540
its purpose of life is accomplished.

223
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:46,220
When two soulmates come together
to reproduce, an Avatar is born.

224
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,300
Our job is just to find the soulmate,

225
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:52,660
the Avatar will handle everyone else.

226
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,700
And where will this Avatar come from?

227
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,580
I wasn't born a human,

228
00:18:09,780 --> 00:18:11,020
but an Avatar.

229
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,580
My fathers' unusual
pharmaceutical practices,

230
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,980
my mother's ancient yoga practices and

231
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:19,020
once-in-a-lifetime planetary positions

232
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,780
combined and I came to Kali Yuga.

233
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,860
At the age of four, I
knew the Gita by heart.

234
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,260
Whenever religion decays an Avatar
is born to reinstate truth of...

235
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,740
I would deeply feel,

236
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,860
that I was born to change
the direction of time.

237
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,180
Father,

238
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:45,220
where are we going?

239
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:50,020
My father would have replied,

240
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:52,300
but in 1975,

241
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:55,540
Indira Gandhi's government

242
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,820
fearing my father's
protests took him away.

243
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,820
He never came back.

244
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,100
My father never told
me whose Avatar was I,

245
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,580
I needed to find out myself.

246
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,180
Whom did I need to destroy?

247
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,460
I would ask myself
that question everyday.

248
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,460
One fine day, the answer appeared.

249
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:20,380
I needed to destroy the world

250
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:25,140
this world that could not
accommodate a wise man like my father.

251
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:28,620
I needed to destroy Kali Yuga

252
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:31,340
and bring Satya Yuga.

253
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,420
You can try all you want, Ganesh.

254
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,860
but Satya Yuga will definitely arrive.

255
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,460
And when that happens,

256
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,740
you won't be able to live
with any of your lies.

257
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,380
Trivedi, do whatever you
got to do in prison now.

258
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:07,260
Lies such as: you hate your father.

259
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:11,340
Lies that he is dead.

260
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,780
You will never find peace.

261
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:19,220
Ganesh, there's still time.
Walk the path of forgiveness.

262
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,580
Save yourself and your father.

263
00:20:40,260 --> 00:20:43,780
Dilbagh Singh also wished
to see the new world.

264
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:58,380
I am glad you thought about it.

265
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,940
What do you need from me?

266
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:24,780
Gaitonde killed Guruji
and stole the Kaal Granth.

267
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,860
Malcolm searched for it
everywhere but was unsuccessful.

268
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:32,300
You are the last person he spoke to.

269
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,940
You both have a cosmic connection.

270
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,220
He must have told you something.

271
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,180
You need to think harder.

272
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,940
Whether you help us or not,
this world won't survive.

273
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,740
You have two options,

274
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:56,140
either you die like a nobody,
or you help bring a new world.

275
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,180
A new world you can be a part of.

276
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:04,860
A new world, Dilbagh Singh believed in.

277
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:27,780
All good, Sardarji?

278
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Yes.

279
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:39,100
A Lot of work needs to be done
before we enter the new world.

280
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:42,820
No problem. We'll get it done.

281
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:27,700
Thank you.

282
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,900
I've been trying the numbers,
found in Anjali's Diary

283
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,380
constantly, but I can't find a lead.

284
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,780
My eyes ache staring at them.

285
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:41,300
I don't know what we're doing, sir.

286
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,380
Rama...

287
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,300
we're short on time.

288
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,460
Sorry.

289
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:52,500
Your family stays here as well, right?

290
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,020
Yes, in Sewri.

291
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,940
Tell them to go back to the village.

292
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,420
- Where is the village?
- Vidarbha.

293
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:07,140
The Chief Minister will make the
evacuation announcement by evening,

294
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,340
but it'll be too chaotic by then.

295
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,420
Tell them.

296
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:28,900
Sartaj,

297
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,460
What are you doing?

298
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,220
Where are you going?

299
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:33,700
Sartaj.

300
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,980
Joseph Sir, Sartaj has
gone into the evidence room.

301
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:49,380
Sartaj... open the door.

302
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,780
Sartaj...

303
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,220
Open! Sartaj!

304
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,380
INTERNATIONAL DHAMAKA

305
00:24:57,460 --> 00:24:59,460
Open the door...

306
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:02,260
Open the door...

307
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,020
Aye, open!

308
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,580
- Stop!
- Sartaj!

309
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Aye, Sartaj!

310
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,420
Sartaj, put your gun
down. You can't escape.

311
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,700
- What are you doing?
- Close the door.

312
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,900
Sartaj...

313
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:40,980
- [
- Come in.

314
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,940
How did all this happen?

315
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:51,300
- Umesh?
- He is gone out.

316
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,095
This news is reminiscent

317
00:25:54,096 --> 00:25:56,100
of the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004.

318
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,532
The destruction caused
by this event was such,

319
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,180
that took years to reverse.

320
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,900
This world is about to end.

321
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,420
... has triggered a tsunami, that's...

322
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,180
- What?
- It's considered to...

323
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:10,620
- Sartaj...
- The Mumbai Police has allegedly,

324
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:14,180
been asked to escalate the evacuation
process in the city overnight.

325
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:16,670
From Kanyakumari to Port Bandar,

326
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:18,220
coastal cities have
been put on high alert...

327
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:19,300
Sartaj...

328
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:21,060
We're getting information...

329
00:26:21,140 --> 00:26:22,300
Please rest for a bit.

330
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:23,900
Huh?

331
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,740
Will go to the doctor soon.

332
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:29,340
Please, leave from here.

333
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:30,820
Please!

334
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:32,660
The tsunami alert is fake.

335
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:36,420
For the past 20 days, we've
been searching for a bomb.

336
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,820
This city needs to be evacuated,

337
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,540
otherwise millions will end up dead.

338
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,500
Only 40 hours are left..

339
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,940
Yeah, okay.

340
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,220
We'll leave.

341
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,620
Please rest for a bit.

342
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,980
I'll be back soon

343
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,334
I repeat do not stay at home,

344
00:26:59,335 --> 00:27:01,660
you will not be safe in your homes.

345
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:03,156
The authorities have said,

346
00:27:03,157 --> 00:27:06,780
not to head to higher
altitude regions in city.

347
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:09,450
I repeat, do not go to higher regions,

348
00:27:09,451 --> 00:27:13,750
police will have no way to retrieve you.

349
00:27:13,940 --> 00:27:16,600
Parents are advised to
carry infants in their arms,

350
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:17,660
to prevent an injury.

351
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,580
I think this will fit you.

352
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,100
... carry your personal
belongings with you,

353
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,740
to make your journey quicker.

354
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,420
I'll be back soon.

355
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,950
... please follow the instructions,

356
00:27:29,951 --> 00:27:33,620
move in haste and be safe. Goodbye.

357
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,460
My dad was a character.

358
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,420
He was the village priest

359
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,460
and used to beg for donations.

360
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,900
He loved me,

361
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:51,260
but he killed my mother.

362
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,860
I didn't know whether I should have been

363
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,460
happy or sad, after the
police took him away.

364
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,980
Trivedi, do whatever you
got to do in prison now.

365
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,900
Trivedi, do whatever you
got to do in prison now.

366
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,020
What will happen in 25 days?

367
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,460
Everyone will die.

368
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:18,100
- Only Trivedi will survive.
- Trivedi who?

369
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:32,020
You're going to call the cops here?

370
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,820
I'm not going to call,

371
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:38,780
they are waiting downstairs.

372
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,700
I have proof of every
kind of debauchery,

373
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,620
that takes place in this

374
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,140
beautiful home of yours.

375
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,180
Don't you know how to
talk straight, faggot?

376
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,205
Why've you kept them waiting downstairs?

377
00:28:58,206 --> 00:29:00,380
Should've invited them up here.

378
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:07,820
Hey, all of you come
up! Your pimp here...

379
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,740
- What's your name?
- Sharma.

380
00:29:11,980 --> 00:29:13,300
Sharma...

381
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,860
here is throwing empty threats.

382
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,060
Come up if you've got balls.

383
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:21,460
I want to speak to Gaitonde.

384
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,500
Please, hold a bit harder.

385
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,940
I want to speak to Gaitonde.

386
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,300
You want to speak to Gaitonde?

387
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:40,980
You needed the cops
help to say just that?

388
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:57,460
Hello. Some dickhead
has come to speak to you.

389
00:29:58,420 --> 00:30:00,700
- What?
- Some Sharma...

390
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:02,780
He looks like a dick.

391
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:05,500
- Who's this Sharma?
- Speak to him.

392
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,740
Aham Brahmasmi.

393
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:17,180
Ganesh, what have you done?

394
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:20,220
What do you want, motherfucker?

395
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:23,940
I want a meeting.

396
00:30:24,220 --> 00:30:26,940
Yeah, I'll tell you later.
Get the fuck out of there.

397
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,020
You done?

398
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
You done?

399
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:33,820
Get out of here.

400
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:41,900
Miss Yadav...

401
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,260
Excuse me.

402
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,620
I told you not to...

403
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:50,180
Do you remember anything
about Gaitonde's father?

404
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,100
You've startled her, by
asking all these questions.

405
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,020
May I please get a glass of water?

406
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,460
Please.

407
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,020
I'm sorry... but this is urgent.

408
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:06,660
Is Gaitonde's father alive?

409
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,540
Is Gaitonde's father's name Trivedi?

410
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,860
Gaitonde killed his mother.

411
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,860
But it was the father
who went to prison.

412
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,140
- He told me...
- Water.

413
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,900
Can you please wait
outside for a moment?

414
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,700
She doesn't speak in front of you.

415
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:25,620
Please.

416
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,260
Is his father alive?

417
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,220
I had written it.

418
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:36,100
In a diary?

419
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:39,220
Miss Yadav, where did you write it?

420
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:42,420
Where did you write it?

421
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:45,660
Where did you write it?
Where did you write it?

422
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:47,380
Let her go!

423
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,620
Mother!

424
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,780
What are you doing?

425
00:31:59,180 --> 00:32:00,860
She must have made some notes.

426
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:04,140
She would have given you some
information if she wanted to.

427
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:07,540
And if she didn't want to, she
would have kept quiet. You saw...

428
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:20,020
Leave now.

429
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,900
Aye, Mutthu.

430
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:12,020
It's Mathu, not Mutthu.

431
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
That's what I said. Mutthu.

432
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:17,180
You're going to keep acting
like teenagers your whole life?

433
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,740
- Look straight, please.
- Click it.

434
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:23,180
- When will the passport be made?
- In 4 days.

435
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,420
Boss, what kind of jobs
are we going to do now?

436
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:28,060
We're going to go to China.

437
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,940
The Chinese are taking over the world.

438
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:33,540
We're going to crack deals for them.

439
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:35,180
Holy fuck,

440
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,140
back to where we started from.

441
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,500
No,

442
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:43,780
this is going to be like
formal white collar jobs.

443
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:46,380
Boss, what's the deal with Guruji?

444
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:49,540
Didn't I tell you not
to talk about that?

445
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:53,060
I always knew there was something
off with that faggot Guruji.

446
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:55,140
You want me to send you a memo now?

447
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,620
Didn't I fucking say not to
mention that fuckers name?

448
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,580
Sorry, Boss.

449
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,020
Ganesh...

450
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,100
How long we have to hide like
this boss, lets kill that cunt.

451
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,940
How did he find out?

452
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,380
Nothing leaked from our end.

453
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,340
Ganesh,

454
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:13,460
why don't you hide in your
bunker. Nobody can reach you there.

455
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,740
It gets lonely there.

456
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,780
It's better here with you guys around.

457
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,220
Hey Gaitonde,

458
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,300
what are you thinking about?

459
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,540
I've never seen you like this before.

460
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,980
You won't mention it to anyone, right?

461
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,860
I won't, tell me.

462
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,100
Tell me.

463
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,460
I hear a voice...

464
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,740
Guruji's.

465
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,460
Voice?

466
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:03,740
Here.

467
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,860
Inside my head.

468
00:36:08,100 --> 00:36:09,500
All day and night,

469
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:12,740
even in my sleep.

470
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:15,500
It keeps telling me random shit.

471
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:17,780
It curses at me, it gives me advice...

472
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:20,540
At times it feels real,
at times I feel I'm crazy.

473
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,100
I'm losing my...

474
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,540
No, no, no.

475
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:27,660
Gaitonde, don't worry.
We're all here together.

476
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:34,180
You haven't had this for a while.

477
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:38,540
Just keep it on your
tongue and it'll be fine.

478
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:42,540
Shall we go...

479
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:45,540
or are you going to piss
out the whole sea right here?

480
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,020
Chill. Hold on a second.

481
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,020
Listen...

482
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,980
Bring Trivedi to me. I want to meet him.

483
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:34,820
That's my father, Sardarji.

484
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:38,100
The thorn of my life.

485
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:31,700
I think this is for you.

486
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,300
Don't want it.

487
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:38,500
You take care of your sins,
I'll take care of mine.

488
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,340
Dear Dad,

489
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:56,220
please forgive me. I could
not do anything for you.

490
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,340
I am sending you a book.

491
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,620
If you take this book to Batya,
she'll take you in to Satya Yuga.

492
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:05,940
There is everything in this book.

493
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:10,980
The story to end this world and
the mantra to start the new world.

494
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:16,420
And if I know Guruji, the way to
save the world is in here as well.

495
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,180
Majid Sir...

496
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,180
M...

497
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,020
Hello, sir. One number got traced.

498
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,420
- Hello, Nair.
- Yes, Gama.

499
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,860
- How's the weather?
- Its hot.

500
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:51,740
This is Haroon, his right hand man.

501
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:54,260
Its great. Cold, like ice-cream.

502
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,180
We'll come over with
customers? Ready to serve?

503
00:39:57,260 --> 00:40:00,340
- Yes, come. Don't be late.
- Okay, Gama.

504
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:01,820
Bring a spoon.

505
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:04,300
The phone isn't switched
off. It's in downtown.

506
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,820
- Rama, send the live location.
- Let's Go.

507
00:40:16,460 --> 00:40:18,580
- What happened, sir?
- Listen.

508
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,820
Have you seen him?

509
00:40:22,820 --> 00:40:24,060
He's staying in 202.

510
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,500
Get up!

511
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,060
Get up, motherfucker!

512
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:45,180
Where's Shahid Khan?

513
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Where's Shahid Khan?

514
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:40,500
You can go back if you want.

515
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,660
But there's same pain

516
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:46,020
and same failures there.

517
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,540
Will you come with us?

518
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:12,900
Aham Brahmasmi.

519
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,000
