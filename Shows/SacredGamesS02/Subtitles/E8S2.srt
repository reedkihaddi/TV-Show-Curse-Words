00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,620
- Hello, Naz.
- Yes, Dad.

3
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:26,460
- How are you?
-  I'm good, Dad. How are you?

4
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:29,140
I'm good.

5
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:32,060
Where's grandma?

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:33,660
She's here.

7
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,420
How's she doing?

8
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,540
Not so good.

9
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,900
Her memory's really giving up.

10
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:46,460
She keeps saying random things.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,300
- Like what?
- One minute.

12
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:51,820
Father is on the phone.

13
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:54,740
My father.

14
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,460
Your son, grandma.

15
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:01,140
Mother.

16
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:06,700
- Shahid?
- Wow, you recognized me.

17
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:11,300
When will you take me
to the Golden Temple?

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:15,020
See what I mean, Dad?

19
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:20,500
Mom, I had told you

20
00:01:20,660 --> 00:01:23,180
not to talk of these
things in front of anyone...

21
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:27,380
You had promised me we would go.

22
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,780
Yes, we will go.

23
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,620
I'm making the arrangements.

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,620
Really?

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,820
Yes, Mom.

26
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,780
I'm your son.

27
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,340
Whether I meet you or not,

28
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,500
the Golden Temple is yours.

29
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,540
I just...

30
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,460
... need your blessings.

31
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,860
The evening news, lakhs
of men, women and children

32
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,460
are crossing the Radcliffe line,
marking the border between the two

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,980
nations India and Pakistan...

34
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,180
- Hurry up son
- Yes father, almost done

35
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,060
- Show me some light.
- Here.

36
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,660
Satti, turn that off.

37
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,860
Mother.

38
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:43,860
You hear that?

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,940
I'm telling you, Sheru's following us.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,020
- It's not Sheru.
- Sheru!

41
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,180
Sheru!

42
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,340
Navneet, have you gone crazy.

43
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,420
- Stay inside and be quiet.
- But Sheru?

44
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,140
We've come 15 miles. Sheru
can't follow us that far.

45
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,100
Navneet, Sheru will be safe.

46
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,220
He's neither Hindu nor Muslim.

47
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:04,540
- Please stay inside, sweetheart.
- Why did you leave him there?

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,260
Navneet.

49
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,460
Calm down.

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,420
I can hear his bark.

51
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,900
- Navneet!
- Sheru!

52
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:20,100
- Navneet!
- Sheru! Sheru!

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,900
- Prabjyot you stay inside.
- Sheru!

54
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,180
- Sheru!
- Stop.

55
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:27,460
Navneet!

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,020
Leave me.

57
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:35,220
Leave me.

58
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:37,540
- Leave the girl.
- Leave.

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,380
- Dad...
- Stay back

60
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,260
Leave me.

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,740
- Leave me.
- Go inside!

62
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,260
- Dad...
- Go inside!

63
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,660
Dad...

64
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,540
Golden Temple...

65
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:25,100
Speak up! Where's Shahid Khan?

66
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,340
Motherfucker, I'll open your mouth.

67
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,980
- Do you know where the bomb is?
- Not yet.

68
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,980
- When will we know?
- We made few raids.

69
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,900
- What will that do?
- We arrested one.

70
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:02,540
Joseph, I am extremely disappointed
with your team's inefficiency.

71
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,940
Whenever we ask you say we are on it!

72
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,540
Get me results

73
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,420
- or be ready for suspension.
- You can suspend whomever you want,

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,380
but this is not the time for threats.

75
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:15,940
I made a mistake should have given
this case to the Centre a week ago.

76
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,740
And they would have solved
the case with a magic wand?

77
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,140
They wouldn't be waiting
around like your team.

78
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,620
Ma'am I promise.

79
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:29,620
My team will not budge
unless we finish this job.

80
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:33,500
This is our vow and our responsibility.

81
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,620
Sir, I've got a tip.

82
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,220
Sir, one question.

83
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:52,500
We have heard that the
Tsunami threat is hoax

84
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:55,740
covering up a nuclear
threat? Your comments, sir?

85
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:58,100
Lord Ganesh is protecting us.

86
00:06:58,740 --> 00:06:59,820
All will be well.

87
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:02,820
- Sir...
- Sir...

88
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,911
Are you saying that

89
00:07:04,912 --> 00:07:09,260
you were just informed
about the nuclear threat?

90
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,340
You are being called a political
prostitute, in parliament.

91
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,700
What did you say?

92
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,580
Do not touch...

93
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,300
Everyone move back.

94
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,940
All of you are so insistent on
representing a specific community,

95
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,460
that the same community
has become a threat now

96
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,220
under you garb of secularism.

97
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,460
Ask the CM about the
nuclear attack threat.

98
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,740
And ask DCP Parulkar why
Hizbuddin couldn't be located.

99
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,940
Jai Hind. Jai Maharashtra.

100
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,845
And with that explosive confirmation

101
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:44,220
of the widespread rumor,

102
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:48,500
Maharashtra Home CM has sent the
financial capital of the country

103
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,820
into a spiral of shock and horror.

104
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:53,900
If true

105
00:07:54,420 --> 00:08:00,100
this is the biggest threat faced by
India in its 70 years of existence.

106
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,780
We are being informed

107
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,533
that the Centre has activated

108
00:08:04,534 --> 00:08:07,340
multiple companies of
the Army and the CRPF

109
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,780
to control the panic
and neutralize the threat

110
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,220
but it remains to be seen.

111
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,460
Is it all

112
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,260
too little too late?

113
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:27,700
Aham Brahmasmi.

114
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:34,060
Aham Brahmasmi.

115
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:41,220
Aham Brahmasmi.

116
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:48,140
Aham Brahmasmi.

117
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,740
Aham Brahmasmi.

118
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,340
Move it. Take off your pants.

119
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,100
Here.

120
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,300
All okay?

121
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:06,180
Or should I show you by
peeling off the skin as well?

122
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,740
Gaitonde will peel off
the skin, don't you worry.

123
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:13,020
You look like an actress trying
to get a break in the movies.

124
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,100
Put your clothes on.

125
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:18,140
Sinner.

126
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:22,340
Move.

127
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,380
Stop.

128
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,140
What is all this?

129
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:46,140
What is all this?

130
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
The new world.

131
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,620
Isn't this what you
wanted to make. Enjoy.

132
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,220
Ganesh, why did you do it?

133
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,420
We'll forget Guruji's murder.

134
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,540
We have already forgotten.

135
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:06,060
Just give us Kaal Granth (Book of Time).

136
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,780
Pull it out.

137
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,340
Is there anything to drink?

138
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,580
- Has he come?
- Yes

139
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,460
Mathu brought him.

140
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,140
Ok then.

141
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,300
Our biggest problem is
that we think small...

142
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,900
Isn't that what Guruji taught us?

143
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,300
I've called you hear to
listen, not speak. Understood?

144
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,340
And tell Malcom to get off my ass.

145
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:09,020
- It will be done.
- And cancel this bomb planting bullshit.

146
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,740
Did you get that, motherfucker?

147
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,300
Understood?

148
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:30,620
Don't start something you
can't finish motherfucker!

149
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,660
Cunt!

150
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:47,220
Leave me. Leave me.

151
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:52,060
Motherfucker, Stick to
speaking, knives are'nt toys.

152
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,660
Don't try to be something you aren't.

153
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,300
And what are you Gaitonde?

154
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:09,780
Faggot,

155
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,580
you've forgotten who I am?

156
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,820
- Who are you?
- I am Gaitonde.

157
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:16,660
Who is Gaitonde?

158
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,220
I am Ashwathama.

159
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,180
And who made you Ashwathama?

160
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,220
- Huh?
- You created me?

161
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,660
Not me. Your daddy!

162
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,260
- You made me?
- No.

163
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,220
Faggot, did you make me Ashwathama?

164
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:31,860
Saved you. Destroyed you. Clothed
you. Gave you food, did everything.

165
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:34,180
You are a stray dog.

166
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:37,540
We made you our pet and
took you for a joy ride.

167
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:41,700
While you stuck your
tongue out of the car.

168
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,100
Who killed Subhadra?

169
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,140
- Isa.
- Was it Isa?

170
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:49,455
It was those buttfuckers:
langoor, ghaslet, Abdul.

171
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:52,140
Bunty got rid of them all.

172
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,100
Try to remember his face. Try, try.

173
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:56,500
You had met him at Guruji's Ashram.

174
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:01,780
Remember Lohane? He had
later given you water as well.

175
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,260
We staged every character in your life.

176
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,460
Who do you think sent
Jamila to your cell?

177
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,460
- Bunty.
- No I had.

178
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:13,460
You became a shriveled penis in jail.

179
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,300
Jamila got you hard again.

180
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:20,340
Who got you out of prison?
Tell me? Who was it?

181
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,500
He is lying, Ganesh.

182
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,060
You're lying.

183
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:25,500
I took you out of prison.

184
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,020
You're not Ashwathama. Neither a King.

185
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:32,060
You're just a slave
for Guruji's new world.

186
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,260
You're a slave. Nothing more.

187
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,620
- Slave?
- Fucker, you're just a slave for Guruji.

188
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,940
- Motherfucker.
- You are Guruji's slave.

189
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,460
Bastard.

190
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,580
You are Guruji's slave.

191
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,620
Motherfucker, I am Ashwathama.

192
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:52,020
Son of a bitch.

193
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,780
I am Ashwathama.

194
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,380
Motherfucker.

195
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:00,580
Faggot.

196
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:05,020
I am Ashwathama, motherfucker.

197
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:19,060
Boss, write down this number.

198
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,980
+ 971...

199
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,060
Who is it?

200
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,460
Did you kill Subhadra?

201
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,100
Gaitonde.

202
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,900
You killed Subhadra?

203
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,060
I don't kill women.

204
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,700
Tell me what I asked, faggot.

205
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,100
You're right. I must
have killed some women.

206
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:59,020
But I didn't kill Subhadra,

207
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,100
or any of your lovers.

208
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:04,940
And Kukoo, you know, you killed her.

209
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,020
Motherfucker.

210
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,140
Bastard.

211
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,780
It's nice to hear your voice,

212
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,820
to know that you're alive.

213
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,980
Come to Dubai if you
need a place to hide.

214
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:25,900
It's hot, but the meat is great.

215
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,500
You're going to protect me, fucker?

216
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,020
You... Who's dying himself.

217
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,660
You have cancer, right?

218
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:39,860
Speak softly, the devil may hear you.

219
00:16:39,980 --> 00:16:44,340
He arrived as a Messiah
for our Salvation

220
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,380
but hung a martyr of revolution.

221
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,020
What?

222
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,500
A poem by Zulfi.

223
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,740
Say 'Hello' to my city.

224
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:57,900
Your city?

225
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,380
Bombay.

226
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:09,780
All of you are so insistent on
representing a specific community,

227
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,460
that the same community
has become a threat now.

228
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:17,060
Ask the CM about the
nuclear attack threat.

229
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:21,140
And ask DCP Parulkar why
Hizbuddin couldn't be located.

230
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:25,460
And with that apparant
visuals coming from Mumbai

231
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:29,620
it has caused a chaos to the
financial capital of India

232
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:34,060
and with the widespread rumors
the conditions are getting worse

233
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:38,820
with the false news of a
nuclear and Tsunami attack.

234
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,980
Several hundred's are injured with
no hospital staff to tend to them,

235
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,020
Several subway's and bridges...

236
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:09,900
Parulkar,

237
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,700
you've come to apologize again?

238
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,260
Do you also want a diplomatic passport?

239
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,340
Do you also want a diplomatic visa?

240
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,100
Hey...

241
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,220
Huh?

242
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,580
Do you also want a diplomatic visa?

243
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:50,100
We're facing a fucking storm

244
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,900
and everyone is concerned
with their fucking Visa

245
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:54,700
Motherfucker.

246
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,820
Speak up, Parulkar.

247
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,000
All the religions of the world

248
00:21:56,001 --> 00:22:01,020
have manipulated the idea
of God, desecrated it,

249
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,180
in a time when Humanity
was rotting beyond repair

250
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:09,940
a small group of enlightened souls

251
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:12,020
came together.

252
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,300
To restart this beautiful world

253
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,780
with consciousness

254
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,100
as its central pursuit.

255
00:22:21,060 --> 00:22:25,260
The world, as we knew it
and were born into, is over.

256
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:31,220
A new world dedicated to pure life,

257
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:37,220
will replace the old dark world.

258
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,260
When the cloud clears,

259
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,380
Satya Yuga will begin.

260
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:07,220
Aham Brahmasmi.

261
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:14,660
- Aham...
- Brahmasmi.

262
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:21,140
Aham Brahmasmi.

263
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,340
- When did you find out?
- How does it matter?

264
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,740
We had mutually decided
that we won't have children.

265
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,260
Did we not?

266
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,780
- Did we not, Sartaj?
- Yeah, we did.

267
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,780
Because you didn't want to.

268
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,740
Yes, I didn't want to. Does
my choice have no value?

269
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:47,740
What is the problem in having one

270
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:50,260
The problem is that your ego is hurt.

271
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:52,340
The problem is you don't say the truth.

272
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:55,380
And the truth is you don't
think I can take care of a child.

273
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,240
And that's why you keep
making up random excuses like:

274
00:23:57,241 --> 00:24:00,940
choice, the crowded cities
and god knows what else.

275
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:05,460
Megha, you have no idea
how bitter you're making me.

276
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,580
All this will end

277
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,660
and we'll have to
start everything again.

278
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,500
How will this all end?

279
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,420
While the world outside
may get destroyed,

280
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,260
The real one resides within you.

281
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
How will that disappear?

282
00:24:45,340 --> 00:24:49,060
Megha, you do not know.
Everything will end.

283
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:52,460
You are angry I made
my choice on my own.

284
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:54,340
And you?

285
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:58,180
Whose going to destroy
this entire world?

286
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,180
Have you consulted anybody
else before doing this?

287
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:04,500
You're just imagining
that everything will end.

288
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,940
You might forget everything

289
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,710
about this day, your anger,

290
00:25:09,711 --> 00:25:14,620
the ego behind it, and
the guilt behind your ego.

291
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:20,740
But your lack of
self-worth will never end.

292
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:29,380
Fighting the world isn't going
to solve anything, Sartaj.

293
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,300
You need to wage war with yourself.

294
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:35,000
I kept thinking of my cursed life,

295
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,940
I couldn't have had worse one.

296
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:44,380
But when I put the gun to my head,
everything became clear to me.

297
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,900
The sweets my mom made on Diwali...

298
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,900
The rush from jumping into
the icy pond in the village.

299
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:56,900
The way my heart grew
soft and beat faster

300
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:59,340
when a girl hugged
me for the first time.

301
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,060
I thought I'd melt.

302
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:07,180
Bunty's dance moves...

303
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,820
Mathu's English after getting drunk...

304
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,660
And Kanta Bai's head
always smelling of fish...

305
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,780
I realized, they must have
shared such soothing moments too.

306
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,260
I started seeing all their lives...

307
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:35,580
But it all vanished within a second:

308
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,740
Every beautiful moment,

309
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:41,020
those people, those places...

310
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:43,140
Everything got burnt to ashes.

311
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:46,700
By the time I understood all
this I was already in my grave.

312
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,700
But you are not, Sardarji.

313
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:52,460
Save this world.

314
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:55,145
All the religions of the world

315
00:26:55,146 --> 00:27:00,060
have manipulated the idea
of God, desecrated it.

316
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:05,620
in a time when humanity
was rotting beyond repair

317
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:09,140
a small group of enlightened souls

318
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,220
came together.

319
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:22,940
What's your name? What is
your name? Say your name.

320
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,820
Haroon Bilal.

321
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:29,820
- How long have you been in India?
- Since 2013.

322
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:32,100
Where is your home in Pakistan?

323
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,940
Peshawar.

324
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:39,540
Haroon, where's Shahid Khan?

325
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,900
Don't know.

326
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,500
Where's the bomb?

327
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,180
Its with Shahid

328
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:51,860
Where's Shahid?

329
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,620
You both had decided
the bomb's location.

330
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,460
You know! Didn't you
both decide the location?

331
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,060
Doctor, increase the dosage.

332
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,420
Haroon, what can be seen

333
00:30:37,421 --> 00:30:40,940
from where the bomb is
planted? What can be seen?

334
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:43,940
Mumbai.

335
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,260
What's ahead of it?

336
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:47,340
Any local train tracks?

337
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,620
- No.
- Metro tracks?

338
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,100
- No.
- Can the ocean can be seen?

339
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,580
- No
- Can a lake be seen?

340
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:02,780
Can a lake be seen, Haroon?

341
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:39,060
Hello.

342
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,940
I'm busy now. Later.

343
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,380
So?

344
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:53,180
Driver, stop the car.

345
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,300
- What now?
- I hear voices sometimes.

346
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:10,260
They're telling me you betrayed me.

347
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:12,740
Get out of here. I need to go.

348
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,540
Malcolm's after my ass and
Guruji's stuck in my head.

349
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,740
I need to know the truth from you.

350
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,980
What the fuck are you talking about?

351
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:24,260
Let me go to church I'll
talk to you after that. Scoot.

352
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,780
Drive the car. Take a right.

353
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,380
Did you not hear what I said?

354
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,100
Drive the car, motherfucker.

355
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,540
Why have you brought me here?

356
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:44,940
What is all this?

357
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:47,500
I'm talking to you.

358
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:58,980
I don't have much time left.

359
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:03,020
I wanted to spend what was left
with you, that's why I got you here.

360
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,780
Who had told you to send Jamila to me?

361
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,140
Ganesh, you are very afraid right now.

362
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,380
Shut up, motherfucker!

363
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
Who had told you?

364
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,900
I don't remember.

365
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,780
I only trust you.
Everyone else is fucking...

366
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:33,460
Then don't trust me. Who
asked told you trust me? Don't.

367
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,620
It can't be you.

368
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,620
I can't be that much of a dumb-fuck.

369
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:43,660
Actually, you're much
more than you think are.

370
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:44,780
What do you mean?

371
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,660
Yes, I'm with them.

372
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,620
With who?

373
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,900
From Day 1

374
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,860
They all told me:

375
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,260
"Keep Gaitonde in-check."

376
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,460
- Be quiet.
- Why?

377
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,860
The truth made your cock disappear?

378
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,540
What are you doing?

379
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,300
Jojo, stop it.

380
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,340
Then let me go. Give me the keys.

381
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,500
There's no way out now.

382
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:17,260
Keys to the door.

383
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,340
This door doesn't open with a key.

384
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,060
Does it open with a cock then?

385
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:24,180
Jojo, you motherfucker.

386
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:28,140
You are the motherfucker.
Your father's the motherfucker.

387
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,620
I told you I want to leave from here.

388
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,460
Motherfucker, I'm
going to die in 4 days.

389
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:37,300
Not in 4 days, but in
4 hours, you'll die.

390
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,380
As soon as I get out,
I'm going to tell 'him'

391
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,220
to finish you off.

392
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,580
You know who I'm talking about, right?

393
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,460
- Malcolm?
- Correct answer.

394
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,340
[fading footsteps

395
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,940
How does the door open?

396
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:57,580
For that, you've got to get the cock up.

397
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,740
Yes, I knew

398
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,940
how they took you for
a ride for 20 years.

399
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,540
You cannot fight destiny.

400
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,900
MAHARASHTRA POLICE

401
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,580
- Majid.
- Where are you Sartaj?

402
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:56,940
Did you find the bomb?

403
00:40:57,020 --> 00:41:02,540
Yes, in Powai. The old
parking lot behind the IT Park.

404
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:14,180
Majid? Majid?

405
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
There's a sniper in the building ahead.

406
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:46,580
Majid? Majid? Majid?

407
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,300
Let's move.

408
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:46,420
Move. Move. Move.

409
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,940
You, motherfucker!

410
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,420
You won't speak?

411
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,060
You won't speak.

412
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,620
You won't speak?

413
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,180
You won't speak?

414
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:02,980
Ponnuthai is trying
to diffuse the power.

415
00:45:04,180 --> 00:45:06,180
You won't be able to stop anything.

416
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,700
The bomb you're seeing today

417
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,660
was planted in 1947,

418
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:14,140
it's been awaiting
explosion for 70 years.

419
00:45:14,540 --> 00:45:15,900
How will you stop it?

420
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,260
It needs to be accessed physically.

421
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:32,860
Temps.

422
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:52,180
We got access to the motherboard.

423
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:55,660
- How much time is left?
- Checking, Sartaj.

424
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:01,580
11 minutes 43 seconds.

425
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:07,980
This is asking for a pattern.

426
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,140
We've got only 5 attempts at this.

427
00:46:22,900 --> 00:46:23,940
Incorrect password.

428
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,460
Get up, motherfucker. Get up.

429
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,740
What's the password?

430
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,220
Gazwa-e-Hind.

431
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,580
Say it, motherfucker.
What's the password?

432
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,620
You won't be able to save anything.

433
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,420
Incorrect.

434
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:28,300
- Jigar...
- Sir.

435
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,060
Move all the forces. Evacuate
this place immediately.

436
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,460
Ok, sir. Everybody out, move...

437
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:37,300
We have to move fast, let's go...

438
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:41,180
Sir? Sir? You can't
just leave from here.

439
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:43,900
Are you blind, Sartaj?
Everything's finished.

440
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:46,140
We lost.

441
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:48,740
Move.

442
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,860
C'mon. Let's go.

443
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,540
C'mon. Hurry up.

444
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:27,660
Ma'am, could this be the pattern?

445
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:31,380
Ma'am, could this be the pattern?

446
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:34,860
Let's go Sartaj.

447
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:39,260
Sartaj, we have no time. Let's go.

448
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,060
Come on.

449
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,220
Sartaj.

450
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:04,300
Sartaj, please. Let's go. Please

451
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,460
No, sir.

452
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,180
KAAL GRANTH (BOOK OF TIME)

453
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:02,580
Sardarji, I would have saved
this world if it were so easy.

454
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:08,100
I called you after all doors had shut.

455
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:11,260
There was nobody in this city

456
00:51:11,380 --> 00:51:13,620
who could be trusted
besides Dilbagh Singh.

457
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,700
You have 25 days. Save your city.

458
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,174
But even you didn't listen to me,

459
00:51:19,175 --> 00:51:20,175
and brought the cops with you.

460
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,020
Don't do this, sir.

461
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:26,180
I've been mind-fucked for
the first time in my life.

462
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:28,020
You don't know the whole story.

463
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:29,900
Tell me the rest of it in prison.

464
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:32,980
My story was left incomplete.

465
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:42,740
Guruji used to say that every
big task requires sacrifice.

466
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:49,940
Why do you think I sent you to Bombay?

467
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:53,300
How would I know?

468
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:59,300
Sacrifice of the most
dear is always the Purest.

469
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,740
So you wanted to sacrifice me?

470
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:10,900
Ganesh, this world
is resting on stories.

471
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:15,100
there aren't any
stories, without sacrifies

472
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:18,260
there wouldn't be any scriptures.

473
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:25,580
God, heroes, villains, principles.

474
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,620
Ganesh, these are all stories.

475
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:41,460
If not you someone else
will do the Sacrifice...

476
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:44,700
Come with me.

477
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,180
Our work will never stop, Ganesh.

478
00:52:48,260 --> 00:52:50,140
Who did Dilbagh Singh make you meet?

479
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:52,060
Our work will never stop,

480
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:54,820
drop your gun.

481
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:02,540
RIGHT PATH

482
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:06,700
Son,

483
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:15,060
do not be ashamed. You tried your best.

484
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,340
Aham Brahmasmi.

485
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,540
Aham Brahmasmi.

486
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:10,000
